investors whom he once embraced and who had fueled the country's rapid growth.", "the move had the intended effect of bringing home the malaysian currency, insulating it from the speculators mahathir blames for the crisis, and giving an adrenaline jolt to the now self-contained economy.", "it is a move that seems in tune with a recent round of questioning of the economic orthodoxy of the international monetary fund.", "but few foreign economists expect it to work for long.", "`mahathir is attacking the fundamental beliefs of the free market, of capitalism, of wall street,' a foreign diplomat said.", "`we are either watching economic theory being rewritten or reconfirmed _ and i don't think it's being rewritten.'", "the day after making his economic gamble, mahathir set off the most severe political crisis of his tenure, dismissing anwar, the man he had been grooming to be his successor.", "two weeks later, anwar was arrested at his home and held incommunicado for 10 days,

control of the levers of power and the lack of focus or leadership in the opposition, mahathir could ride out the storm as anwar's trial proceeds.", "but he has struck a harsh blow to the morale of his own nation, to the sense of confidence he had worked so hard to build under the slogan `malaysia can!'", "in this generally decorous nation, the depth of anger expressed by two men who once called each other father and son is disturbing to hear.", "anwar, says the prime minister, is `despicable' and `a sodomist.'", "mahathir, says his former deputy, is `senile' and `insane.'", "malaysians, who

kosovo's ethnic albanians even after a u.n. resolution demanded a cease-fire.", "in a widely anticipated report to the security council, annan listed apparent violations of a sept. 23 u.n. resolution, decried the `appalling atrocities in kosovo,' and said it was `clear beyond any reasonable doubt' that yugoslav forces were responsible for the bulk of them.", "the u.n. chief also said rebel forces

army units' in southeastern kosovo near albania's border.", "the european union nations were divided monday on whether to launch air strikes without u.n. security council backing.", "the eu foreign ministers, meeting in luxembourg, agreed to tighten economic sanctions against milosevic, but it was unlikely that stricter travel curbs for yugoslav officials and freezing more yugoslav assets abroad

that violence will resume, particularly among refugees, tens of thousands of whom are living in the hills and forests without shelter.", "under nato threat to end his punishing offensive against ethnic albanian separatists in kosovo, president slobodan milosevic of yugoslavia has ordered most units of his army back to their barracks and may well avoid an attack by the alliance, military observers and diplomats say.", "milosevic, who on one hand is excoriated by washington as the scourge of kosovo yet on the other hand is treated as key to peace in bosnia, acted as the european union, nato and the united nations prepared for a review on monday of possible military intervention.", "russia stepped up its warnings against such action and dispatched its foreign and defense ministers on an unusually high-level mission to see the yugoslav president sunday in belgrade.", "as he has so often, milosevic appears to have bowed to foreign demands in the nick of time and yet still accomplished what he wanted.", "this weekend, foreign diplomatic observers in kosovo reported that a `military stand-down' had taken place in the province, where milosevic's forces have waged a fierce offensive against albanian rebels.", "the observers said that except for segments of three brigades, most units of the yugoslav army were `home.'", "the daily reports of the observer mission, made up of u.s., european union and russian military experts, are one of the key elements in helping washington and european capitals decide whether milosevic has met their demands for a cease-fire.", "by putting the army back in its barracks, sending some police units out of kosovo and ordering an end to burning and looting of villages, milosevic may well avoid a nato attack, diplomats here and in washington said.", "but at the same time, they acknowledge that while nato looked the other way, he enjoyed a three-month license to overwhelm the kosovo liberation army _ the rebel army fighting for independence for kosovo and its ethnic albanian majority _ and terrorize the rural civilian population that supports it.", "his military operation created more than 250,000 refugees, whom the clinton administration is gearing up to take care of this winter through a variety of relief organizations.", "u.s. officials said they expected richard holbrooke, the u.s. envoy who dealt with milosevic in negotiating an end to the war in bosnia, to meet with him on monday to discuss a political plan for kosovo.", "the heart of the disagreement in kosovo is between serbia, yugoslavia's principal republic, which insists on keeping kosovo as a province, and the ethnic albanians there who have chafed under milosevic's repression since he stripped the province of virtual autonomy in 1989, and who now seek independence.", "the west, fearing the precedent that independence for kosovo would set in other conflicts in the world, has been trying to mediate a middle course.", "in essence, diplomats said they believed that the plan holbrooke will present to milosevic calls for a three-year interim period leading to a status fairly close to the pre-1989 autonomy arrangement.", "since the kosovo conflict flared up in march, critics of washington's policy toward milosevic argue that he has been able to choreograph every move to suit his goal: pushing the albanian population into submission with impunity.", "`the united states and its allies have waited four months while he cleaned the clock of the kosovo liberation army,' said morton abramowitz, head of the international crisis group, a policy analysis organization, `and taken three weeks to discuss military action, with the result that 500 albanian villages were destroyed.'", "administration officials now acknowledge that when nato failed to live up to its earlier threat in june to strike serbia, milosevic took advantage of the indecision and plunged ahead with an artillery and tank offensive against the lightly armed guerrilla forces, whose bedrock of popular support had helped win them effective control of large swaths of kosovo territory, including key roads.", "while he was doing that, milosevic skillfully managed a key requirement for washington: he made sure that the war did not spill over into neighboring albania and macedonia, fragile countries in a traditionally volatile area.", "all along, the biggest fear in washington has been that the kosovo conflict would engulf neighboring countries and encourage albania and the ethnic albanian population in macedonia to join the cause.", "such a possibility raised the specter of a new balkans conflict just three years after peace was secured in bosnia.", "milosevic catered to washington's concern that the conflict be contained.", "the yugoslav army mined kosovo's borders with macedonia and albania, ensuring that few refugees could escape and limiting routes for arms supplies for the rebels.", "the yugoslav leader also understood that washington was unsure about how to deal with the disorganized albanian political leadership in kosovo and the unbending kosovo liberation army, whose main chiefs were hardened emigres returned from switzerland and germany.", "for example, holbrooke persuaded milosevic to meet in may with ibrahim rugova, the top albanian political leader in kosovo, an encounter that turned out to be little more than a photo opportunity.", "for that procedural breakthrough, holbrooke recommended the lifting of a ban on foreign investment in serbia that had been put in place the month before.", "after meeting with rugova, milosevic stepped up his military operations in kosovo, forcing washington to reverse itself again and carry out the investment ban.", "in late june, holbrooke met with two self-styled kosovo guerrilla commanders in the province's western town of junik but then broke off all contact.", "clinton administration officials said at the time that they were concerned that nato intervention would bolster the separatist forces.", "to try to put the best face on the situation, washington worked with moscow to get milosevic to accept the presence of international monitors who would patrol kosovo and report on military action.", "the monitors were slow in getting organized.", "by august, when the yugoslav army, backed by the serbian special police, were in full swing against the rebels and burning and looting villages in the process, the monitors found it difficult to gain access to the fighting.", "they drove up to roadblocks, knew something was going on from the sounds and the smoke, but could not be precise.", "in recent days as the tanks and artillery have withdrawn, access has improved, the monitors say.", "but there are some areas in central kosovo around likovac and gornje obrinje that the monitors have ruled off limits because of land mines on the roads.", "the mines are believed to have been planted by the guerrillas.", "gornje obrinje was the site of a massacre of 18 ethnic albanian women, children and elderly people on sept. 26. a british reporter who walked across fields into the village on sunday said about 10 mortar shells, apparently from the serbian police or the yugoslav army, were fired at the village early sunday afternoon.", "the yugoslav army and police forces have been responsible for the vast majority of atrocities in the kosovo conflict, said a report by new york-based group human rights watch, released here on sunday.", "the report said the rebels had also violated the laws of war by taking civilian hostages and carrying out summary executions.", "but the violations by the guerrillas were on a `lesser scale' than the government abuses, the author of the report, fred abrahams, concluded.", "the report focused on what it called a watershed in the conflict _ the attack by police forces on three ethnic albanian villages in late february and early march in the drenica region of central kosovo.", "at least 83 people, including 24 women and children, were killed in the attack, which involved helicopters, artillery and armored personnel carriers.", "in the yugoslav capital, belgrade, which is a four-hour drive north through rolling countryside from kosovo's capital of pristina, milosevic remains politically secure.", "that is in part, his domestic critics say, because diplomats like holbrooke and the head of the u.n.refugee agency, sadako ogata, insist on going to see him, thus enhancing his stature.", "the american envoy richard holbrooke met with president slobodan milosevic of yugoslavia monday night and according to american diplomats told him that he had to take further steps to pull back his military in kosovo province or face a nato attack.", "milosevic was also told, the diplomats said, that he had to insure that the roughly 250,000 ethnic albanian refugees who have been forced to flee their homes in the fighting in the last six months be allowed to return home.", "most of these refugees are reluctant to return because many of the serb police officers who destroyed their homes and villages remain in the neighborhoods.", "after delivering his sternest message so far to milosevic over the kosovo conflict, holbrooke said at a news conference that nato's military plans for attacking serbia were moving ahead on a `serious, intense and sustained basis.'", "holbrooke's mission to milosevic was described by the american diplomats as `not a do or die trip,' but they added, `we're at a very serious juncture.'", "shortly after holbrooke's meeting with milosevic, the yugoslav leader issued a defiant statement on serbian television in which he said the `threats of aggression' outlined by holbrooke represented `a criminal act.'", "milosevic, who rarely comments about his meetings with foreign diplomats and whose tough words cast an unusually ominous tone, also said that holbrooke's position constituted `support for albanian terrorists and not the albanian people.'", "milosevic was apparently accusing holbrooke of supporting the ethnic albanian guerrillas of the kosovo liberation army, who have been fighting to make the serbian province of kosovo an independent nation.", "the yugoslav leader added that `for more than seven days there have been no skirmishes or military action.'", "an american diplomat familiar with the themes holbrooke planned to stress to milosevic said there had been no expectation that the american envoy would walk out monday night with an agreement.", "rather, the point was to underscore to the yugoslav leader and make explicit what was expected of him.", "`it was not quite an ultimatum,' the diplomat said, `but more a matter of what steps have to be taken to show compliance.'", "the essence of holbrooke's demands centered on issues outlined in a united nations security council resolution of two weeks ago.", "the resolution ordered milosevic to withdraw the extra army and police forces that were sent to kosovo to deal with the guerrillas and to send back to their bases the military forces normally stationed in the province.", "so far, american diplomats said, milosevic has withdrawn troops from the field but not all of them are in their barracks.", "such a move is essential, american diplomats said, to create a conducive atmosphere for any possible negotiations on the future status of the province.", "the u.n. resolution also calls for a political solution.", "holbrooke and the u.s. ambassador to macedonia, christopher hill, discussed with milosevic a political document drawn up by the state department that calls for broad autonomy for kosovo.", "milosevic withdrew the autonomy in 1989 as he began his campaign of serb nationalism.", "the countryside in central kosovo has been eerily silent since last thursday.", "the sound of artillery thuds and mortar rounds have been noticeably absent and the coils of white smoke that signified burning villages have vanished from the green hills and valleys.", "police checkpoints are more relaxed and areas that were sealed off this time last week by the yugoslav army are now open to the patrols of diplomatic monitors from the united states, european union and russia.", "these monitors, many of whom are former military officers, have reported that the yugoslav army has `stood down' and that they have seen virtually no military action since late last week.", "there has been sporadic shooting, the monitors have reported.", "but this superficial calm is not good enough because the serb military has the capacity to resume fighting very quickly, a nato military officer said monday.", "the officer added that a cease-fire in kosovo is `pretty much enacted.'", "he also said that the `trend toward compliance is positive.'", "the interior ministry police must also reduce their presence around villages so that refugees who have fled have the confidence to return, the military officer said.", "some interior ministry police officers had left the province, but not enough, he added.", "on the question of how badly damaged the kla had been by the yugoslav army's three-month offensive, the nato officer said, `it's a fair assessment that the kla is dismantled but not destroyed.'", "holbrooke's first stop monday was brussels, where he met with the secretary-general of nato, javier solana.", "on tuesday he plans to travel to pristina, the

korea, confirms the disturbing reports by international aid workers, who over the past year have gained increasing access to the population of this highly isolated and secretive country.", "among

suffer from stunted growth.", "they have discovered that, despite a huge international food aid program over the past three years, severe malnutrition is widespread among toddlers at crucial stages of brain development, suggesting that this generation's physical and mental abilities will not develop normally and that the losses can never be recovered.", "separately, international medical workers from groups like the red cross, have begun to document how the effects of food shortages are being severely compounded by a breakdown in public health services.", "even basic water purification systems stand idle for lack of essential ingredients like chlorine, red cross workers say, leaving vast numbers of people with such severe diarrhea that they are unable to absorb completely what little food they have.", "as the north korean dictatorship has slowly, often grudgingly, granted increased access to international aid groups in the last six months, an increasingly clear and saddening picture of the hunger haas emerged as a result of the large formal study and informal surveys and observations by foreign aid agencies.", "past assessments of the magnitude of the disaster in the country of 23 million are considered flawed because they were based on interviews with a small number of north korean refugees who had fled into china.", "and while the researchers and aid workers on the ground in north korea have not seen evidence of cannibalism or starving children dying by the roadside _ descriptions that have surfaced in the more lurid refugee reports _ what they did find was in many ways equally disturbing: a population withering after nearly a decade of chronic hunger, people so weakened by malnutrition that colds and stomach flus quickly turn lethal, the future of a generation irretrievably lost.", "`now at last we have hard facts _ the situation is very grave,' said judith cheng-hopkins, regional director for asia of the world food program, which has taken part in the research.", "`to me this is a famine in slow motion.", "people cope year after year, and probably a lot drop off.", "but the totality is very hard to gauge.'", "for three weeks this fall, crews led by foreign scientists were finally permitted to fan out across north korea to conduct the first random sample nutritional survey of children, providing by far the most solid data on the crisis.", "they found that 62 percent of children under 7 had stunted growth, a symptom of long-term malnutrition.", "thirty percent of 1-year-olds suffered from moderate to severe malnutrition.", "this means a high likelihood of impaired mental and physical development, because the nervous system matures dramatically during this essential first year.", "the researchers said that available scientific data suggest that 10 years ago, malnutrition was rare in north korea.", "`even if the situation improves, it is unlikely to improve to the degree that the country will fully recover from what we saw,' said judit katona-apte, a senior program adviser for the world food program.", "`people will be small and not as well developed as otherwise and somewhat limited in their mental capacities.'", "likewise, when red cross representatives this year tested the water supply at the 840 hospitals and clinics where they operate, they found that not one had water that was suitable for human consumption, said sten swedlund, head of the red cross delegation in north korea.", "`but of course they drink it _ they have no choice,' he said during a recent trip to beijing.", "`there is a very close relationship between the problems caused by the lack of food and a health sector that's in very bad shape.'", "virtually all the children under 7 who are malnourished also have diarrhea, he said.", "none of the aid groups has been able to study the issue of hunger-related deaths, and the north koreans have not released relevant figures, although most experts agree that probably more than one million and perhaps as many as three million have died prematurely since the food shortages began.", "but public health experts say the number who have perished might be difficult to tally in any case, because most deaths were probably not from quick starvation, but from immune systems weakened by years of hunger, so that common colds more easily give way to lethal pneumonia and an ordinary bout of infectious diarrhea proves fatal.", "still, there are some disturbing clues: in one limited study conducted by the world food program and other groups last year on 4,000 children hand-picked by the government, 10 percent had a parent who was dead.", "in this fall's independent nutritional survey, 18 teams of experts sent to eight of north korea's nine provinces looked at 1,800 rural and urban children under seven.", "in addition to finding that 62 percent of children had stunted growth, the teams found that about 16 percent of children were suffering from acute malnutrition and were underweight for their height, a sign that they were severely underfed at the time of the study.", "that figure is higher than in any country in east asia and puts north korea among the world's worst 10 countries in terms of malnutrition.", "while that 16 percent figure is not quite as bad as that of india and bangladesh, the worst in the world with an 18 percent malnutrition rate, experts say that north korea's number in some ways understates the problem.", "in india and bangladesh, pockets of severe poverty alternate with pockets of relative plenty, while in north korea the whole country is to some degree underfed.", "`even in war-torn countries, famine is more in pockets,' dr. katona-apte said.", "`it's hard to think of another country that's been affected in this way.'", "the survey results are especially sobering since the researchers studied only children under 7, the group that received nearly all the food donated from abroad.", "after three years of food donations, many foreign aid workers in the country have remarked that children in nurseries and kindergartens are looking better _ but that their older siblings are failing.", "so a month ago, the world food program began providing elementary schools with high nutrition biscuits for children aged 7 to 12.", "`we have reason to believe that many people are suffering and that the elderly are a neglected age group that is just getting weaker and weaker,' swedlund said.", "there are now more than 100 westerners living in pyongyang, the capital city, and many say the long-term hunger is readily apparent there.", "`if you walk down the street in pyongyang and ask a child how old she is, you are usually off by three years,' swedlund said.", "`she may be 7 but she looks just 3 or 4.'", "dr. katona-apte, a nutrition expert who has worked in bangladesh and the sudan, said she was shocked when she first visited a north korean kindergarten last year.", "`there were these two children sitting at a desk who were obviously severely malnourished _ they were so thin and they had patchy hair,' she said.", "`and they were just sitting there working.", "this is accepted as normal!", "they are in school, and they should really be hospitalized or placed in nutritional rehabilitation.", "if you saw them in a refugee camp, you would recommend immediate intervention.'", "but with a severely depleted public health and hospital system, that option does not exist, she and others said.", "many korean doctors do not know how to diagnose or treat malnutrition; few had seen it before this decade.", "and, in any case, the hospitals lack the food and proper nutritional supplements.", "swedlund said most hospitals lacked medicines, had no glass to replace broken windows and were `colder inside than out,' having received no coal since 1994. he said that even in hospitals, sanitation and water purification systems were virtually nonexistent, because the country lacks chlorine for purification and fuel to run water pumps.", "he said that next year, the red cross would start to address those problems, spending $3.5 on food for hospital patients and $1 million on water treatment.", "with few other options, vast numbers of north koreans have resorted to eating `substitute food,' hard cakes and noodles made from a mix of nutritional plants, like soybeans and sweet potatoes, combined with indigestible filler, like cornstalks and straw.", "`this now constitutes 40 percent of food intake,' swedlund said.", "`it's becoming a regular part of the food basket.'", "doctors in north korea say many people suffer from stomachaches after eating this partly indigestible material, he said, but added, `if you're very hungry, it fills your stomach.'", "although the north koreans date their food problems to a series of floods and droughts in the mid-1990's, the foreign researchers who have worked in north korea say medical records and childhood growth patterns indicate that the hunger began several years before that and is linked to the collapse of the soviet union, which had long been north korea's main supplier of food, fuel and fertilizer.", "north korea is a mountainous country, with less than 20 percent arable land.", "it has been a food importer for decades, mostly from the former soviet union, but also from china.", "`the country has to come to grips with the fact that this is part of a structural problem and can't just be blamed on the weather anymore,' ms. cheng-hopkins said.", "still, she and others praised the normally rigid and secretive government for slowly loosening its restrictions.", "swedlund said that after three years in the country, the international red cross, which collaborates with the north korean red cross, had found officials increasingly responsive and doctors more willing to share medical records and bring up problems.", "travel is still restricted.", "there are more than 100 counties, home to 30 percent of the population, to which aid groups have no access and where they have therefore refused to provide food or medical supplies.", "still, the number of counties open to the workers has increased steadily, and freedom to move about has improved.", "ms. cheng-hopkins said about half of follow-up inspections were now unannounced, and she noted that the researchers in the nutritional survey were allowed to select villages to visit and enter homes at random.", "workers from the red cross and the world food program said they had not observed extreme scenes of people dying of acute starvation and believe that they would have if they were occurring frequently.", "`i have not seen acute starvation like i have seen in bangladesh,' dr. katona-apte said.", "`but that doesn't mean it can't exist.", "we're still really limited in what we can see.'", "swedlund said it was unlikely that the counties still closed to foreigners were markedly different from the open ones.", "and while some have surmised that the closed counties might harbor pockets of death and devastation, he said he accepted north korea's explanation that they had been excluded from some areas for national security reasons.", "`one thing i've learned is how important national security issues are to the north koreans,' said swedlund, a retired admiral in the swedish navy.", "`and i really think these areas are important from that standpoint,' he added, going through a map of closed areas and describing what western intelligence experts know about military installations there.", "he also rejected the notion that the north korean military is stealing donated food, a charge leveled by the organization doctors without borders, when it angrily pulled out of north korea last summer to protest the many restrictions on groups working there.", "now that aid groups say they are starting to get somewhat better cooperation from the north koreans, they hope to repeat their nutrition survey every 6 to 12 months.", "and they are still analyzing some tantalizing findings: boys were twice as likely to suffer from stunted growth as girls, and every child whose mother was dead was malnourished.", "`a generation of north korean children is already

millions of messages it obtained by subpoena from competitors in pretrial discovery.", "warden's cross-examination ritual is to present a government witness with an internal e-mail from his company

prevailed not because it is a predatory monopolist but because of its superior technology?", "microsoft is accused of trying to prod companies to stay out of its way.", "so last week, for example,

official in the justice department's antitrust division who is now at the brookings institution.", "it can also be powerful ammunition for pointing to contradictions in testimony.", "and that is what the government will do in attacking gates' credibility with his videotaped deposition, taken over three days in august.", "the government offered a glimpse of that strategy on the first day of the trial.", "it showed a few brief clips of a point in the deposition when gates was asked about a meeting on june 21, 1995, at which, the government alleges, microsoft offered to divide the browser market with netscape and to make an investment in the company, which is its chief rival in that market.", "in the taped deposition, gates says he recalled being asked by one of his subordinates

e-mail on may 31, 1995, gates urged an alliance with netscape.", "`we could even pay them money as part of the deal,' he wrote, `buying a piece of them or something.'", "the contradiction between gates' deposition and his e-mail, though, does not of itself speak to the issue of whether microsoft made an illegal offer to netscape.", "to be sure, it is what microsoft did _ not what it said in

generates revenues from its browser, which it now also distributes for free, but from the sale of heavy-duty software sold to corporations.", "much of this software is used as the technological `back office' for electronic commerce _ used in building web sites and processing transactions.", "a surprising element in the proposed deal is that aol intends to hold onto netscape's corporate software

internet media and electronic commerce services could be delivered to many more homes than today because many people still shun the expense and difficulty of using a personal computer.", "the

vice president for legal affairs, said monday morning on the courthouse steps.", "the reasoning behind this assertion, microsoft says, is that the proposed deal demonstrates that netscape and the larger software industry are healthy and vibrant _ even with all of the illegal and anti-competitive practices alleged in the government's suit.", "but david boies, the government's lead attorney, said all of that was irrelevant.", "`whatever the deal ends up being _ if there ends up being a deal _ is not going to remove any of the obstacles that microsoft has placed in the path of competition in this industry,' he said.", "michael lacovara, a microsoft lawyer who was questioning a government witness, economist frederick warren-boulton, suggested to him during the trial monday that the proposed acquisition undermined warren-boulton's argument, that microsoft seems headed toward obtaining a monopoly in internet browser software to match the one it apparently holds in operating systems.", "after all, about 22 percent of americans who use the internet reach it through america online.", "and at present aol uses microsoft's web browser, internet explorer, as the service's default choice.", "in exchange for that, microsoft places an aol advertisement and internet link in windows 98. lacovara asked the witness whether, once aol's service contract expires in january, he would `expect aol to continue to distribute microsoft software.'", "yes, warren-boulton responded.", "`it is not at all clear to me that aol's incentive to do this is changed by this proposed merger with netscape.'", "he noted that america online officials had said their need to be among the online services featured in windows forced them to accept microsoft terms _ establishing internet explorer as the default choice.", "lacovara then asked warren-boulton the question that lay under his entire cross-examination of the witness _ and microsoft's larger assertion monday about the proposed netscape-aol deal.", "`surely this combination,' he asked, `tells you something about the nature of competition in the software industry?'", "warren-boulton's answer was probably not the one lacovara had been after.", "`to the extent that this potential merger is the result of microsoft's actions with these exclusive contracts and other actions,' he said, `it is unfortunate to see the disappearance of a firm like netscape, the brightest, newest star.'", "warren-boulton's purpose on the stand for the government is to establish that microsoft does have a monopoly in operating-system software; more than 90 percent of the world's computers use a microsoft operating system.", "that is the foundation under most of the government's case since federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior by a monopolist that would be legal for a firm that faces healthy competition.", "through repeated, often circumlocutious questioning, lacovara tried to make the case that microsoft's overwhelming market share was ephemeral.", "the software industry is so vibrant and fast moving, he suggested, that microsoft could be toppled from its position at any moment _ a point of view the company encourages among its employees.", "on friday and monday, lacovara repeatedly pointed out that other companies are placing other operating systems on the market, and some software companies _ principally microsoft's greatest rivals _ are writing software for these new systems.", "but warren-boulton argued that `the existence of these fringe competitors in the operating system market does not mean in any way that microsoft does not have monopoly power.'", "on monday afternoon, lacovara made an issue of the success apple computer co. is having selling its new imac computer.", "he entered into evidence an apple news release issued last month showing, among other things, that 12.5 percent of the people buying apple's new imac computer had previously owned a windows machine.", "apple computers use a different operating system, mac-os.", "envisioning a thoroughly networked world in which the world wide web is a limitless marketplace of information, entertainment, products and services, america online inc. tuesday laid out the details of its agreement to buy the netscape communications corporation for $4.2 billion.", "by moving quickly toward what both companies have recently come to see as the inevitable convergence of technology and media, america online hopes that it will secure a solid lead in a battle already joined by giants like the microsoft corp. and the international business machines corp. to transform the greater part of cyberspace into a vast virtual mall.", "part of that vision rests on an alliance with sun microsystems that america online negotiated as part of the deal.", "sun not only brings a cyber-savvy sales force to the effort but, even more importantly, a strong technology partner in developing netscape's industrial-strength software for running internet sites.", "sun is indeed a technology heavyweight.", "it owns the java programming language specially designed for internet applications, and solaris, among the most popular commercial operating systems for the powerful computers that big corporations use to serve up internet services like the world wide web, e-mail and retail transactions.", "it also manufactures a highly respected line of powerful computers based on its own microprocessor chips.", "but for america online _ and for the big internet players against which it will compete _ the real potential gold mine lies further down the road, perhaps five years away, when people will venture on line for information or shopping not only from personal computers but from inexpensive internet appliances costing $200 each, or maybe included free as part of a subscription service, just as some cellular phones are now.", "today, being wired remains a comparatively elitist activity _ an estimated 25 percent of american households had access to the internet last year, and 5 percent of households bought merchandise on line.", "but the executives at america online and netscape hope that their deal will accelerate the timetable for the day when the net is ubiquitous, when people will tap into the world wide web from appliance-like devices, pagers, cell phones, television set-top boxes or computers as routinely as they use the telephone today.", "`a new generation of internet devices to be able to deliver our service anywhere is a key part of what this deal is about in the long run,' said stephen m. case, 40, the chairman of america online.", "for the present, however, the idea is to make america online, the nation's leading online service, the standard way to get onto the internet, the executives explained.", "netscape, the internet pioneer, is a crucial part of that effort, they said.", "there is no assurance that this vision of the technological future will prove accurate or, even if it does, that the america online-netscape combination will lead the way.", "still, the long-range game plan helps explain what brought america online and netscape together.", "and the ability of the companies' executives to sell that vision to netscape's whiz-kid programmers in particular will determine whether the merger succeeds.", "netscape's headquarters in mountain view, calif., is likely become a prime target for silicon valley headhunters.", "as is the case with any software company, netscape's key asset is its talented programmers, and many of these code hackers may be reluctant to work for america online, which still has a reputation as a middle-brow service catering to online newcomers, known derisively as `newbies.'", "stock options and other financial incentives will be tailored to try to keep netscape employees on board.", "`but these people want to change the world, and we've got to be clear that joining with america online, along with the sun component, really is a bigger opportunity for us,' said marc andreessen, the 26-year-old cofounder of netscape who led a team of young programmers from the supercomputing center at the university of illinois to silicon valley to start the internet software company in 1994.", "`this ought to be the preeminent internet company over the next decade,' andreessen declared, speaking from a cell phone on a streetcorner in palo alto, calif. for his part, andreessen, a netscape executive vice president, will become netscape's chief technology officer for the next three or four months, until the merger is completed.", "his new job at america online has not yet been determined, but it is likely to be chief technology officer of the combined company as well, an america online executive said.", "already, according to one netscape board member, andreessen has delivered a 12-page single-spaced memorandum to case, setting out his view of the technological road map the new company should follow into the future, emphasizing the opportunities for electronic commerce in an environment in which most people are linked to the internet.", "netscape, populated with computing sophisticates, and america online, known as an on-ramp to the internet for the technologically challenged, seem a corporate odd couple.", "but the two companies, its executives explained, had been evolving toward each other for more than a year.", "in a telephone interview from america online's headquarters in dulles, va., case described netscape as an enterprise that had `morphed itself' from a company dependent on sales of its software used to browse the world wide web _ and `in microsoft's cross-hairs' _ into a business that relied on advertising and other revenues from its popular netcenter web site and from selling software to corporations to handle electronic commerce.", "the netscape transformation was largely a reaction to microsoft's competitive assault on its browser business _ a central element in the government's antitrust suit against microsoft.", "microsoft bundled its browser into its industry-standard windows operating system, and gave away the browser for free.", "the government alleges these steps were part of a pattern of anticompetitive practices, while microsoft maintains the moves were intended mainly to benefit consumers.", "early this year, after laying off workers and suffering a large loss last year, netscape announced that it would also distribute its browser for free.", "it seems to have stabilized its business around its new model.", "netscape announced tuesday that it earned $2.7 million on revenues of $162 million in its fourth fiscal quarter, which ended in september.", "yet america online has also changed in the last couple of years, moving well beyond its reputation as an online service for beginners.", "it now has an internet chat service and runs its own all-in-one site on the web, known as a `portal,' which includes e-mail, internet searching, news, entertainment and online shopping.", "`america online has really changed from a closed online service for novice users to an internet media and technology company with a diverse set of brands,' andreessen said.", "`these two companies have been moving in the same direction, and the fit is a good one.'", "the new york times said in an editorial for wednesday, nov. 25: america online's effort to acquire netscape and set up a partnership with sun microsystems is a reminder of how rapidly the corporate landscape can change in fast-moving technical fields.", "but it does not lessen the need for the justice department to vigorously pursue its antitrust suit against microsoft, the dominant player in software.", "the department has presented solid evidence that microsoft has used its monopoly in operating systems to muscle rivals and partners so as to head off competition in other software realms.", "the internet has risen so quickly as an information medium that only four years ago, in his book `the road ahead,' bill gates scarcely mentions it.", "in addition, only a couple of years ago america online, the world's biggest online service, was having so much trouble getting rid of the bugs in the system it was widely derided as `america on hold.'", "now microsoft has moved so aggressively into the internet that the justice department is accusing it of predatory behavior, and america online has rocketed forward to make deals with other internet players.", "in its antitrust suit against microsoft, the federal government charges that the company has illegally bundled its own browser with its windows operating system to smother netscape's chances of marketing its browser.", "now in the corridors outside the antitrust trial microsoft's lawyers maintain that netscape has found a new partner in america online and has no need of protection from the government.", "but it could be as easily argued that microsoft has bludgeoned netscape into dissolution, forcing a distress sale to america online.", "nor is it clear that customers of america online will choose netscape's browser as a vehicle for buying and selling on the internet.", "even in its newly musclebound form, america online remains dependent on microsoft's good will for favorable placement of an aol icon on the main desktop screen.", "it may be that, years hence, america online, netscape and sun will put together an alternative means to the internet through telephone lines, cables or the like.", "but until that day, fairness requires justice department action to insure that microsoft not use its current position to thwart consumer choice.", "only when companies know they can get their products to the consumer will they have the incentive to innovate and turn the internet into the revolutionary medium it promises to be.", "america online built itself into the most potent force in cyberspace largely by appealing to families with chatty teen-agers who want

country into an overnight depression.", "`then they said everything that went wrong was our fault,' he said.", "`but now, now i think people know that much of the problem came from the outside, and we need something better.'", "and the imf itself is beginning to fight back, an awkward role for an institution dominated by ph.d. economists who are unaccustomed to being openly challenged.", "`every place you turn you read the same story, that we came in, that we made things worse,' said stanley fischer, the deputy managing director of the fund, who was born in northern rhodesia _ now zambia _ and became chairman of the massachusetts institute of technology's economics department before taking a job that has now put him in the center of the financial storm.", "`we frequently get the blame,

be loved, but more than that we'd like to be effective.'", "miscalculations, politics and safety nets on a steaming january day, michel camdessus, the imf's top official, slipped into jakarta to the private residence of president suharto and sat down for a four-hour meeting to tick off, line by line, the huge reforms indonesia would have to implement in return for tens of billions of dollars in emergency aid.", "two previous deals had collapsed when suharto ignored the fund's conditions, so camdessus insisted that he strike a deal directly with suharto, then asia's longest-serving leader.", "it was a meeting of men who knew different worlds of power politics: suharto rose as a general in central java, and camdessus had detonated mines in algeria for the french army before entering the french treasury on his way to becoming head of france's central bank.", "`it was all there,' a senior imf official recalled.", "`he was told he had to dismantle the national airplane project, the clove monopoly, all the distribution monopolies.'", "at one point, camdessus looked at the impassive suharto and said, `you see what this means for your family,' a reference to their vast investments in the country's key industries.", "`he said, `i called in my children, and they all understand.'", "but within months, that exchange in jakarta came to symbolize the imf's twin troubles: its inability to understand and reckon with the national politics of countries in need of radical reform, and its focus on economic stabilization rather than the social costs of its actions.", "suharto had no intention of fulfilling the agreement.", "it was, one of his former cabinet members said, `a delaying move that was obvious to everyone except camdessus.'", "perhaps one reason why the imf sometimes appears tone-deaf is that its senior staff is almost entirely composed of ph.d. economists.", "there are few officials with deep experience in international politics, much less the complexities of javanese culture that were at work in indonesia.", "historically, experts in politics and security have gravitated to the united nations, development experts to the world bank, and economists to the imf _ creating dangerous gaps in a crisis like this one.", "as a result, the fund had only a rudimentary understanding of what would happen if its demands were met and all indonesia's state monopolies were quickly dissolved.", "while that system lined the pockets of the suhartos and their friends, it also distributed food, gasoline and other staples to a country that stretches for 3,000 miles over thousands of islands.", "to help balance the budget, the fund demanded a quick end to expensive subsidies that keep the price of food and gasoline artificially low.", "but that, combined with the huge currency devaluation that sparked the crisis, resulted in high prices and shortages that fueled riots that continue to this day, as millions of indonesians lose their jobs.", "the imf _ unintentionally, its officials insist _ also sped suharto's resignation, insisting on the elimination of `crony capitalism,' code words for removing the suharto family from the center of the economy.", "ultimately, that may prove to be indonesia's salvation, if the new government can contain the rioting against the ethnic chinese minority _ whose money is desperately needed to save the country's fast-shrinking economy.", "`it is worth noting,' fischer said this week, `that our programs in asia _ in indonesia, korea and thailand _ only took hold after there was a change in government.'", "nonetheless, the indonesia experience has revived the argument that the imf is so focused on stabilizing banks and currencies, on preventing capital flight and freeing up markets, that it is blind to the social costs of its actions.", "among the toughest critics has been its sister institution, the world bank, whose main charge is alleviating poverty.", "`you've seen the tension almost every day,' one senior world bank official said recently.", "the bank has gone to extraordinary lengths in recent months to differentiate its role from that of the fund, and to announce a tripling of aid to the poorest in the countries hit by the economic chaos.", "even u.n. secretary general kofi annan has joined the argument, warning in a speech at harvard recently that `if globalization is to succeed, it must succeed for poor and rich alike.", "it must deliver rights no less than riches.", "it must be harnessed to the cause not of capital alone, but of development and prosperity for the poorest of the world.'", "imf officials say they are changing strategies when they see they are exacting too great a social cost.", "`it's a very difficult formula to get exactly right,' fischer said in august, as russia was teetering and the imf was sending in $4.8 billion in aid that was rapidly wasted.", "`you need enough discipline to send the right message to the markets and keep investors from fleeing.", "but you need enough leeway to keep people from suffering more than they otherwise would.'", "in recent months, he noted, the imf has allowed more spending to sustain subsidies for basic goods for longer periods in indonesia, korea and elsewhere.", "`there is a new flexibility at the imf' a senior indonesian official concluded recently.", "`it is a lot better.'", "a u.s. pawn, or a runaway agency?", "the clinton administration admits that the imf has many failings, many of them on display this year.", "but it insists that the world has gone through

devaluations, more defaults, more contagion, and greater trade dislocations _ without the program agreed with the imf and the finance it has provided,' deputy treasury secretary lawrence summers told congress last week.", "many republicans and some democrats are unconvinced.", "even though the senate has overwhelmingly approved an $18 billion contribution to the fund to help it fight new crises, the house defeated that measure two weeks ago.", "the fund's last hope of getting the money, which will free up nearly $100 billion in contributions from other nations waiting for the united states to act, will come when the house and senate try to resolve their budget differences in a conference committee in the next 10 days.", "a rejection, treasury secretary robert rubin insists, would send a message around the world that the united states is turning its back on the one institution charged with restoring economic stability.", "everywhere else in the world, though, politicians and businessmen insist that one of the biggest problems with the imf is that, contrary to the view of congress, it acts as the u.s. treasury's lap dog.", "ask in jakarta or moscow, and the response is the same: the imf never ventures far without looking back for the approving nod of its master.", "when the united states weighs in, however, is when the imf is called on to rescue a country in deep trouble.", "only then does the imf _ and the u.s. treasury _ have the leverage to extract commitments in return for billions in aid.", "in theory, the u.s. influence is limited: it has an 18.5 percent vote in the fund.", "germany, japan, france and britain have about 5 percent each.", "but in practice the united states usually gets its way, exercising its influence behind the scenes, often in interactions between fischer and summers.", "the two met when fischer was on the mit faculty and summers was a graduate student taking one of his classes, later becoming a colleague at mit.", "each served as chief economist of the world bank.", "it was summers who was instrumental in placing fischer in the fund's no.", "2 job, and these days they talk constantly.", "`it's usually a warm relationship,' fischer said this summer.", "`remember, this is a job where you cannot turn to outsiders for advice _ you can't call the chief economist at a wall street firm, or even many of your

trying to coax along political leaders.", "the tensions were obvious from the start of the asia crisis.", "the fund made little secret of its displeasure that the united states was not offering direct aid to thailand, a major u.s. ally, as a sign of support and confidence.", "mindful of the backlash in congress when mexico was bailed out with u.s. money, that was the last thing the treasury planned to do.", "summers, in turn, thought the fund was not forcing the thais to implement its reform commitments rigorously enough or disclose their true financial picture.", "within the u.s. government there was other dissension: the state and defense departments felt the united states should do more for thailand, but backed off when the treasury asked if they would like to pony up some aid out of their own budgets.", "there were other conflicts.", "when japan used the last imf meeting to propose setting up a $100 billion `asia fund' _ one that would exclude the united states and would probably offer aid under much more relaxed conditions than the imf does.", "rubin called up camdessus at breakfast one morning and told him that the japanese proposal would undercut the imf's authority.", "`we've just had a dispute with michel,' rubin reported to his aides as he returned to his orange juice and croissant.", "one of them shot back: `and it's only 8 a.m.' camdessus backed down at rubin's insistence and walked away from money that asia could have used.", "japan says it will be back with a similar proposal this weekend, this time for a $30 billion fund.", "camdessus has also rankled u.s. officials with statements that amounted to cheerleading to reassure the markets _ sometimes in the face of the facts.", "in june, with russia on its way to collapse, camdessus declared that `contrary to what markets and commentators are imagining' about the slow collapse of russia's economy, `this is not a crisis.", "this is not a major development.'", "the bailouts of russia and south korea were prime examples of how washington muscles into the imf's turf as soon as major u.s. strategic interests are involved.", "last christmas, as south korea slipped within days of running out of hard currency to pay its debts in december, it sent a secret envoy, kim kihwan, to work out a rescue package.", "`i didn't bother going to the imf,' kim recalled recently.", "`i called summers' office at the treasury from my home in seoul, flew to washington and went directly there.", "i knew that was how this would get done.'", "within days the treasury dispatched david lipton, its most experienced veteran of emergency bailouts, who is leaving his post as undersecretary for international affairs this month, to shadow the imf staff's negotiations with the government in seoul.",

when the united states raced to put together a $17 billion package for russia.", "the imf's staff in moscow declared that russia needed no money at all _ it just needed to enact policies that would restore confidence in investors.", "the americans and germans came to a different conclusion.", "soon after, u.s. officials gathered in the white house situation room to consider what might happen to russia if the ruble was devalued and market reforms collapsed and to push the imf to come up with emergency money.", "so the fund began assembling a last-ditch program to prop up a country that had resisted its reform plans for seven years.", "camdessus, though, was still hesitant, questioning whether the imf should risk its scarce resources in russia.", "`we had to pull michel along,' a senior treasury official recalled.", "as it turned out, camdessus' instincts were right while the approach championed by rubin and summers proved disastrously wrong.", "the first installment of that payment _ $4.8 billion _ was wasted, propping up the currency long enough, in the words of one imf official, `to let the oligarchs get their money out of the country.'", "then yeltsin reversed his commitments, let the ruble devalue anyway, began printing money with abandon and fired virtually every reformer in his government _ resulting in a collapse of the imf agreements and the indefinite suspension of its aid program.", "now, inside the imf and on capitol hill, there are recriminations over `who lost russia.'", "publicly, fischer argues that `there are no apologies owed for what we attempted in russia.'", "but some imf officials complain privately that they let rubin and summers run roughshod over them, striking a deal that fell apart within weeks as the russian parliament rebelled and yeltsin backed away from his commitments.", "summers responds that the united states `took a calculated risk' because `it was vastly better that russia succeed than not succeed.'", "the russian collapse touched off new rounds of economic contagion, with investors fleeing latin america, and triggering huge losses in hedge funds like long term capital, the greenwich, conn., investment firm that needed to be rescued by wall street powerhouses whose money it had invested.", "`russia was a turning point,' said robert hormats, the vice chairman of goldman, sachs &amp; co. `it made the world realize that some countries can fail, even if the imf and the treasury intercede.", "and that changed the perception of risk.'", "now, as the countries meet to face a future that the imf has warned could be very bleak, they need to reverse those perceptions, or watch countries slowly starve for lack of capital.", "the emerging markets are calling for controls on short term investments.",

very polite,' a top u.s. official said earlier this week.", "`not this year.'", "in a season of crashing banks, plunging rubles, bouncing paychecks, failing cropsand rotating governments, maybe it is not the ultimate insult.", "but the nation that bore tolstoy and chekhov, and still regards a well-written letter as a labor of love, is buckling a little this week, because it can no longer wish good

newspapers and parcels.", "the state railway ministry refuses to carry more mail until the post office makes good on some 210 million rubles in old bills _ about $13 million in today's dollars, or $35 million in dollars six weeks ago.", "air mail, which amounts to one of every four or five letters, was also suspended at one of moscow's major airports until this week, when the post office coughed up 5 million rubles for old bills.", "a second airport is still demanding 3 million rubles for past-due debts.", "so much mail is backed up that post offices in moscow and elsewhere have simply stopped accepting out-of-town mail, except for areas that can be easily reached by truck.", "delivery schedules have fallen weeks, and perhaps months, behind.", "`the situation is really extraordinary,' said vladimir sherekhov, the deputy chief of mail service administration in the government's communications committee.", "`we've never had anything like this before.'", "maybe the post office has been lucky.", "extraordinary is the rule elsewhere in russia.", "until friday, the lower house of parliament was preparing to sue the government for failure to provide soap, heat, toilet paper and copy-machine paper in the legislature's monumental downtown offices.", "it turned out that politicians had exhausted their funds by cutting short their recess and returning to address the nation's economic crisis.", "earlier in the week, officials said russia's arctic shipping routes may close next month because half the nation's icebreakers are in disrepair and there is no money to fix them.", "the oldest of the ships is so ancient that its nickname is granny.", "such anecdotal evidence that russia is losing its wheels, like one of its old, ill-maintained volga sedans, is everywhere.", "but oddly, real signs of public distress are not particularly common, perhaps because the system rarely seems to shed a part as big as a postal system.", "if the u.s. postal service is increasingly a pipeline for sweepstakes notices and bills, the russian post office still holds a special place in the national conversation.", "russians still write letters to each other, frequently and fervently, and many in remote regions get their news through the mail.", "millions use the mails to ship canned goods and other provisions to needy relatives and friends in faraway areas, an especially vital service in winter.", "and in the last few years, the post office has become a vehicle for a growing mail-order trade in books, clothes and other catalog items not readily available outside big cities.", "exactly why all this has rumbled to a halt is in some dispute.", "what is clear is that the post office and the railway ministry both suffer from what ails every russian venture, private and public alike: nobody pays his bills.", "the state railway ministry complains that it is continually stiffed by customers who believe the railroads are honor-bound to carry freight whether they are paid or not.", "the government has specified nearly 40 categories of freight which the railroads must carry for next to nothing.", "among the biggest deadbeats are the `power ministries' _ the military and interior departments _ which did not pay during soviet times and feel little need to pay now.", "`it's a psychology formed during the socialist period,' said tatiana pashkova, the deputy spokeswoman for the ministry, `and the same situation exists with the post office.", "we've been in dispute for a very long time.", "always we try to understand their differences.", "but we can't carry cargo for free.'", "no kidding, says the post office: it, too, is owed 200 million rubles by government agencies, and is barred from raising rates even though freight costs are outstripping revenues.", "moreover, the post office is also required by the government to carry some forms of mail, such as pension checks, at reduced rates.", "officials at the state communications department say they also suspect an ulterior motive in the railroads' actions: a struggle to dominate the thriving mail-order business.", "`here's competition between us and the railroads for the delivery of parcels, and i think decisions made by the railroads are mainly explained by this competition,' sherekhov said.", "`they blame us for carrying some commercial cargoes instead of mail.'", "the railways ministry's spokeswoman, ms. pashkova, said such `commercial cargoes' are indeed a problem, but only because the railroads know that the post office has already gotten cash to transport the packages.", "the railroads are still waiting for their share of that money, she said.", "in the meantime, the situation has come to a boil.", "in late september the railroads cut mail service in and out of moscow, effectively decapitating the postal system and forcing officials to draft a fleet of trucks to move letters in and out of the city.", "hundreds of empty and full rail cars have clogged some local yards to the point where moving cars into position for unloading has become difficult.", "at last count, 39 loaded cars were awaiting service at one yard.", "and customers are getting angry.", "`we've gotten all kinds of complaints,' said viktor salikov, a deputy in the communications department's mail shipping center.", "`people are even coming to us, searching for mail that was sent weeks ago.'", "the united states is disappointed by the economic confusion within the new russian government of prime minister yevgeny primakov, said secretary of state madeleine albright on friday, and she warned russia about the dangers of an anti-western policy.", "in her first comprehensive review of u.s.-russian relations since primakov was confirmed as prime minister last month, albright said washington was `deeply concerned' about russia's direction and did not think the crisis there would soon abate.", "`we have heard a lot of talk in recent days about printing new money, indexing wages, imposing price and capital controls and restoring state management of parts of the economy,' she told the u.s.-russia business council in chicago.", "`we can only wonder if some members of primakov's team understand the basic arithmetic of the global economy.'", "while praising primakov, once her counterpart when he was foreign minister, as a pragmatist able to cooperate on key issues with washington, she had harsh words of warning for him.", "`our initial reaction to some of the direction he's going in has not been particularly positive,' she said, adding, `the question now is whether that cooperation can continue.'", "the united states must keep up its aid to russia but is adjusting it to promote the building of democracy and student exchanges as well as arms control, albright said.", "washington does not favor more direct aid.", "`more big bailouts are not by themselves going to restore investor confidence in russia,' she said.", "`in the long run, the gap between russia's needs and its resources must be met not by foreign bailouts but by foreign investment.'", "albright sharply criticized as self-defeating the `many voices in russia who want to shift the emphasis in russia's interaction with america and our allies from one of partnership to one of assertiveness, opposition and defiance for its own stake.'", "russia could not stand alone in the world, she said, and the united states' ability `to help russians help themselves will go from being merely very, very difficult to being absolutely impossible.'", "at the same time, she said, washington would not `assume the worst, for there are still plenty of people in russia who will fight against turning back the clock.'", "and she urged the world _ and american critics _ to `be patient with the workings of the democratic process in russia' and `not start each day by taking a census of reformers in the kremlin,' a census that american officials themselves promoted before president boris yeltsin dismissed the previous government.", "while moscow may continue to oppose any nato use of force against serbian forces in the southern province of kosovo, albright said, nato must be prepared to act regardless.", "if the communist party has its way _ and it has been planning for months _ millions of russians will take to the streets on wednesday for some of the biggest demonstrations in years.", "but now that communists or politicians with the communist stamp of approval are running the country and its economy the question is what the marchers will be demonstrating against.", "president boris yeltsin and his economic advisers were easy targets two months ago.", "but yeltsin seems but a shadow of himself today, and his advisers are gone.", "the communists, who have undergone a sort of resurgence by playing on the discontent, are working hard to cast themselves as outsiders in the government that they help run _ and to keep the focus of the protests on wednesday on yeltsin and his policies.", "even that strategy may backfire, however, because discontent over yeltsin does not necessarily translate into support for his predecessors.", "an adviser to the communist party leader, gennadi zyuganov, made headlines not long ago when he called the new government bourgeois.", "the characterization was striking, because the new prime minister, yevgeny primakov, was one of zyuganov's top choices for the post.", "the deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, yuri maslyukov, is a communist party figure who once headed gosplan, the infamous central-planning program that helped bring the soviet union to ruin.", "`we don't have slogans that are aimed against the government,' the first secretary of the moscow communist party committee, alexander kuvayev, said in a recent interview.", "`all the slogans are aimed against the president and the economic course of the country.", "only the president can fully be blamed for the course that has brought the country to this situation.'", "anger over russia's fate, and their own, is drawing some russians back to soviet-style slogans and old-style hostility toward capitalism.", "the ardently pro-communist newspaper sovietskaya rossiya devoted most of its front page on thursday to what it said were the results of a contest among readers for protest slogans.", "the entries ranged from catchy to kitschy, from,

nothing approaching this sort of economic chaos and despair since 1993, when hyperinflation swept the economy.", "there is no real way of knowing whether the latest travails will produce huge and ugly crowds or small, peaceful ones.", "a deputy editor and political analyst at a newsweekly, itogi, masha lipman, said the situation was not unlike that of 1993, when yeltsin sought, and won, a popular mandate in a referendum.", "he used it to dissolve the communist-dominated parliament and increase his own power.", "that led to an autumn showdown, the shelling of parliament by tanks and the total defeat, for the time being, of yeltsin's legislative opponents.", "`you can interpret this demonstration as a communist mandate, but i don't think they will act like yeltsin,' ms. lipman said.", "`support for the communists is at its smallest level, maybe 20 percent.'", "in a survey of 1,714 people that was released last week the all-russian public opinion center said that nearly half the

shuttle flights, which run about $800 million apiece.", "following a series of intricate maneuvers and the skillful use of the space shuttle endeavour's robot arm, astronauts on sunday joined the first two of many segments that will form the international space station.", "the shuttle and its crew of six snared the russian-made zarya control module after chasing it around the earth in ever-closing orbits throughout the day.", "less than an hour after a rendezvous 240 miles above the earth shortly before 6 p.m., lt. col. nancy currie of the army deftly used the 50-foot arm to grab the 40,000-pound cylinder as the craft passed above russia and to slowly pull it toward the shuttle.", "seeing zarya up close, col. robert cabana of the marines, the shuttle commander, confirmed that two antennas had failed to deploy from the module following its launch from kazakhstan on nov. 20. there were earlier indications that the antennas, which will be used later by the station to manually assist spacecraft dockings, had not extended.", "currie took almost two hours to painstakingly move zarya above the american-made unity docking port positioned in endeavour's cargo bay.", "when the two pieces were aligned within inches of one another, cabana fired small thruster rockets that raised the shuttle, allowing the modules to clamp together.", "the two station pieces, together measuring about 77 feet from end to end and having a combined mass of 70,000 pounds, are the first of 100 major components to be united in space over the next five years to form an orbiting outpost that would weigh almost a million pounds and span an area the size of two football fields.", "more than 40 additional missions by u.s. shuttles and russian rockets will be used to haul all of the components and other supplies into orbit, and astronauts from both nations are to spend almost 1,800 hours doing spacewalks to assemble the entire structure.", "the spece station is expected to cost its partnership of 16 nations more than $40 billion just to construct.", "bringing the pieces together is only the first step in mating them.", "a pair of astronauts are to make three spacewalks this week, the first on monday, during which they will hook up electrical and communications cables, remove covers, attach handrails and perform other tasks to get the modules to work as one unit.", "the most difficult part of sunday's mating of the $240 million zarya to the $300 million unity was bringing them together after the shuttle caught up with the russian unit.", "currie had to use the canadian-built robot arm to place zarya on top of unity without being able to see where the pieces joined.", "unity, raised in endeavour's cargo bay on saturday, is so large that it blocked currie's view of the mating fixtures from the shuttle's windows.", "she used views from remote cameras and a computerized vision system built on the arm to estimate the relative positions of the two large segments.", "the computerized system examined markings on both modules, computed their relationship to one another using the marks and displayed the results on a laptop computer.", "`we've never done anything like this before,' currie said before the flight, adding that she had practiced the difficult maneuver more than 100 times over the last two years.", "the flight of endeavour, which took off from cape

declined to be interviewed friday because his appointment must still be approved by the cabinet on tuesday, an approval that is expected.", "an aide, raanan gisin, said sharon accepted the position so that he could `stem the tide of dangerous developments and contribute to fighting the risks facing israel.'", "a retired general who fought in every israeli war, sharon, 70, is a leading figure of the likud party who has done much battle with the likud prime minister.", "at the most recent party convention, he said that netanyahu didn't know his right hand from his left, which the prime minister dismissed friday as a comment made `in the height of political arguments.'", "and when netanyahu first formed his cabinet in 1996, the fact that he did not give sharon a senior position caused an 11th-hour crisis before the swearing-in ceremony.", "sharon retreated to his family farm in the negev, and david levy, who had been named foreign minister, said he would not serve unless sharon was given a post.", "netanyahu then created a cabinet job, the minister of infrastructures, especially for sharon.", "levy resigned in january after a lengthy power struggle with the prime minister, and since then netanyahu has been serving as his own foreign minister.", "sharon, a member of the old guard, has a complicated political past, highlighted by a string of military victories, and checkered, to many, by his indirect role, as defense minister, in the lebanese christian phalangist massacre of unarmed civilians in the sabra and shatila refugee camps in lebanon in 1982. many israelis, even those who despise his politics, see him as a strong, experienced figure who knows his mind and who is capable of being moderate when he has power.", "friday afternoon, the right-wing political establishment nearly universally applauded the appointment.", "uzi landau, who is a likud hard-liner, said he was relieved to hear confirmed what has been a rumor for weeks.", "`i feel more safe about the negotiations if minister sharon is directly involved,' said landau, who heads the parliament's security and foreign affairs committee.", "`undoubtedly it will facilitate the situation for the

york times said in an editorial on saturday, oct. 10: just days before heading to the united states for critical negotiations with palestinian leaders, prime minister benjamin netanyahu jolted the middle east peace effort with the appointment of ariel sharon as israeli foreign minister.", "the most optimistic reading is that sharon, long an implacable foe of the palestinians, is prepared to make peace with them and then sell it to the israelis who are most opposed.", "unfortunately, he is also capable of wrecking the entire peace effort.", "much will depend on whether netanyahu can control his strong-willed aide, a goal that has eluded other israeli leaders.", "like a political typhoon, sharon has roared across israeli life for better than three decades as a brilliant military commander, a reckless defense minister and an ardent conservative, often leaving destruction in his wake.", "he still bears the burden of his role in the massacre of hundreds of palestinians by christian militiamen in lebanon in 1982. an israeli inquiry found he was indirectly responsible for the killings at the sabra and shatila refugee camps.", "as a leader of the most conservative wing of the likud party, sharon can help netanyahu hold together his shaky cabinet during potentially decisive negotiations with yasser arafat, the palestinian leader.", "that will be fine if sharon is willing to play a constructive role in the peace talks himself.", "but such behavior is not likely to be the first impulse of a man who has famously said he would never shake hands with arafat.",

billion merger of british petroleum and amoco and will now have to re-examine that combination in light of the new talks between exxon and mobil.", "`in the past, when there have been two mergers involving the same industry, the government has considered them together in deciding how to deal with them,' said terry calvani, a former commissioner at the federal trade commission whose clients now include chevron.", "but coming in the aftermath of the shell-texaco and bp-amoco deals, a combination of exxon and mobil, which have significantly overlapping retail and refinery businesses in the united states and europe, poses questions that antitrust officials have not confronted since the 1980s.", "`it's a real test case,' said frederick leuffer, a senior energy analyst at bear stearns.", "`if the ftc let this one go through without major divesting, then everything would be fair game.", "why couldn't gm merge with ford?'", "while the 1911 breakup of standard oil is viewed by washington officials and industry executives as ancient history, exxon and mobil have become the dominant rivals in some retailing and refining markets, and in the production of lubricants and petrochemicals.", "leuffer said he believed divestitures necessary in this case `could be so large that they are deal-breakers.'", "other analysts and lawyers, while disagreeing that the required divestitures could kill the deal, said the companies would nonetheless have to shed significant operations and that they expected challenges to be raised by a broad spectrum of constituents, including competitors, customers and state officials.", "`these are not absolute obstacles,' said john hervey, an analyst at donaldson lufkin &amp; jenrette.", "in the past, when two big oil companies have merged, aggressive attorneys general from the states have almost always become involved in raising questions because of the high visibility of the local gas station.", "`when a state attorney general drives by and sees four stations on a corner and two of them are mobil and exxon, they are certain to raise questions,' axinn said.", "exxon and mobil have significant concentrations of retailing and marketing concerns in the northeast, the southwest and the west coast, where they also have big refining operations.", "because the two companies are involved in everything from exploration and shipping to refining and retailing, the meaning of the deal for consumers will take months for the regulators to sort out.", "the regulators examining such a transaction would dissect each business, determine whether its market is global, national or more local, and determine whether the combined entity has too high a concentration of the business in those areas.", "experts agreed that the regulators are most likely to permit exxon and mobil to keep their exploratory and oil production businesses because those areas are already highly competitive and a merger would not result in higher prices.", "hervey said those markets are already so fragmented that the combined market share of major american and european oil companies is only 17 percent.", "they have been downsized, cut back and re-engineered.", "so when the 900 or so remaining blue-collar workers here at mobil's largest domestic refinery, out of about 1,500 a decade ago, heard last week that their company was discussing a possible merger with exxon, it was like a siren warning them that an already suspect valve might be about to blow.", "`i think it's a terrible thing,' said dick mabry, a refinery operator, as he emerged in the plant's artificial twilight from the main gate after his 12-hour shift ended at 4:30 on sunday morning.", "he stopped to rub eyes rimmed with red, but on this topic his bedtime could be delayed.", "`it's a revival of the standard oil company.", "it's going to put 20 or 30 thousand people out of work.", "i think the justice department should step in and stop it.'", "ernest lewis, whose overalls bore a `big e' patch appropriate to his scale, added his uh-huh's.", "the latest evidence of where things were heading hulked right nearby, he said, glancing over at a new power plant likely to be operated by an outside company without the unions that now man the refinery's generators.", "but if the mobil corp. has to be sold, lewis said, noting the gains in his company stock holdings, a buyer as solid and large as the exxon corp. might be the least of all evils.", "`if we merged with chevron, we'd be moron,' he added.", "a growing american economy that can make a billionaire out of someone with an unproven idea for internet marketing is still sloughing off workers in older industries, in petroleum as much as any.", "those here point to the tote board by the beaumont plant's brick headquarters, that they say shows they have already handled 171 million barrels out of 130 million planned for the full year.", "but the numbers that matter even more are the ones like 89.9, 88.9, even 81.9, on nearby gas stations _ the lowest prices, after inflation, since the depression.", "which is why mobil and exxon are considering combining into the world's largest oil company.", "some people close to the talks cautioned that no deal would be considered by their boards until at least tuesday, maybe wednesday.", "and that is why, beginning last wednesday evening, the phone at the home of jimmy herrington, the president of the oil, chemical and atomic workers local 4-243 rang without stop.", "no, he didn't know about that merger talk on television, said herrington, who also works full-time producing lubricants.", "he had asked some mobil managers, in a meeting earlier this month, about all the rumors, but they said they had heard nothing.", "oil industry analysts say that the first targets of a combined company's efforts to cut billions of dollars in annual costs would be the office staff and the professionals, like geologists and engineers, in the field.", "one company's accountants could almost do the work for two.", "but the crews here fully expect that an exxon or any other buyer would ask yet again whether the refinery could turn more crude oil into gasoline, motor oil and other products with even fewer people.", "union leaders raise the prospect that exxon would have to sell the refinery.", "antitrust regulators, they say, are bound to notice that exxon has refineries an hour's drive in one direction and three hours in the other, along a gulf of mexico crescent that forms the petrochemical industry's home.", "the beaumont plant, a steaming, humming chemistry set lining the neches river off the gulf, has become the prime provider of livelihoods here since it was built almost under the spray of the nearby spindletop gusher.", "with mounting overtime that can stretch a shift to 16 hours or more, workers regularly make $55,000 or $65,000 a year.", "`people go there to retire there,' herrington said, as he drove around the plant's fenced periphery.", "lewis, in his 17th year, is a third-generation employee.", "but his nephew laboring here too is the exception.", "the workers streaming to and from the plant before dawn are mostly balding or going gray, a sign that for a full generation the refinery has been more concerned about how to get rid of workers than how to attract them.", "the cutbacks have, so far, come through attrition, with retirements often encouraged by incentives.", "but the plywood sheets covering the windows of most of the fast food places and gas stations around herrington's union hall advertise that the best times are long gone.", "his members chafe at the experts who come in from wall street to question the justification for every person's job.", "in tiring and dangerous tasks, they question the elimination of most relief laborers in favor of covering vacations and sickness with overtime (although some like the extra pay, and they say the plant has become safer over the years).", "they complain about the growing numbers of outside contractors taking over formerly unionized tasks.", "but with many workers choosing to invest at least some retirement savings in mobil stock, a 1990s ethos is gaining.", "some share credit with the plant's management for the efficiency measures they agree are necessary for true job security.", "some take the attitude that every company is always for sale.", "`they will not be too concerned about what we feel about it,' said sam salim, one of the electrical plant workers whose future is uncertain.", "`but if they fork out $60 billion?", "i'd look it over.'", "with most mobil executives saying as little as possible for now, calls on sunday to the local plant manager and a company spokesman did not elicit a peep.", "union leaders, however, are already squawking.", "'i don't believe creating new monopolies is the way to prop up the industry,' said robert wages, a former refinery operator himself

company buyer would have to keep to its terms.", "many members, who typically came to work after high school, are already molding the oil companies' latest exploits into case studies fit for rapacious mba's.", "`they're the biggest,' said bobby whisneant, an assistant operator in the gasoline and lubrication oil units, referring to exxon.", "he was coming, early on sunday morning, through a plant gate whose white canopy seems borrowed from a self-service station.", "`so they go buy the second biggest.", "that's one way to get rid of the competition.", "i just hope it's not something like the 80s _ buying companies and scrapping them.'", "or something like the robber baron era a century before, said mabry, another operator.", "`didn't the teachers teach us all through school that the

leader was forced to admit to his republican colleagues that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past.", "`it has suddenly come to my attention that there are individuals working together with the media who are investigating my personal background in an effort to find indiscretions which may be exploitable against me and my party on the eve of the upcoming historic vote on impeachment,' livingston declared in a statement after appearing before a shocked house republican conference to head off the disclosure as it surfaced in news reports.", "after hearing his admissions in a closed session, livingston's colleagues gave him a standing ovation of support and said the question of his resigning had never arisen.", "`my fate is in your hands,' livingston told the republicans, according to lawmakers who were present.", "the debate over the president's fate would go forward, republicans later insisted, drawing distinctions between the speaker-elect's revelations and the sex-and-mendacity scandal that has put clinton on the brink of impeachment.", "the president is charged in an impeachment resolution with perjury and abuse of power in his attempt to hide sexual indiscretions.", "democrats offered no immediate comment, but republicans were braced to hear livingston's admissions alluded to in the debate friday by democrats who have decried the investigation of the president as basically a partisan and unfair rummaging through his sex life.", "livingston, saying he had sought spiritual counseling and had received the forgiveness of his family, noted he had several times told reporters during his campaign to become speaker that `i was running for speaker, not sainthood.'", "he added, `there was a reason for those words.'", "`during my 33-year marriage to my wife, bonnie, i have on occasion strayed from my marriage, and doing so nearly cost me my marriage and family,' livingston said in his brief prepared statement.", "but he attempted to draw a contrast with the allegations against the president, asserting: `i want to assure everyone that these indiscretions were not with employees on my staff and i have never been asked to testify under oath about them.'", "the disclosure of the speaker-elect's marital infidelities, disclosed in `rollcall,' a capitol hill newspaper, sent a new jolt of uncertainty among lawmakers as they prepared for the momentous debate over the president's admitted misbehavior in office and whether he should be impeached and tried by the senate.", "rep. henry hyde, the republican chairman of the house judiciary committee who is to bring the impeachment charges against the president, previously was cited by a magazine for an extra-marital affair in his past.", "then, as on thursday night, republicans voiced suspicions that democratic defenders of the president instigated media investigations in an effort to embarrass the clinton's principal accusers.", "but no proof was offered as republicans left their conference, facing the uncertainties of a debate that already promised to be bare-knuckled in its partisanship.", "livingston left the conference surrounded by capitol police, not taking questions from waiting reporters.", "his chief leadership aides immediately rallied in support.", "`some who would rather not struggle with this constitutional question continue to try to twist the debate into an unseemly investigation of private lives,' said rep. dick armey, the republican majority leader.", "in its report on the internet thursday night, rollcall did not disclose its source but made an oblique reference to hustler, the sex magazine.", "larry flint, publisher of hustler, earlier this year advertised an offer of a $1 million bounty for information about e of members of congress guilty of sexual indiscretions.", "`it breaks your heart because we're all subject to human frailties,' said asa hutchinson, r-ark., as he left the conference.", "`this is not a comfortable circumstance for anyone,' he added, insisting the president and the speaker-elect presented two separate issues.", "`we've got a duty to do under the constitution.'", "bob livingston, the incoming speaker of the house, took no public role friday as the debate unfolded on whether to impeach president clinton.", "his previous 24 hours had been his most visible in the month since his party nominated him as speaker and perhaps the most excruciating in his public career: he spent most of the day in a chaotic procedural wrangle over the terms of friday's debate; he ended it by telling his republican colleagues that he had had extramarital affairs during his 20-year tenure in congress.", "his disclosure followed an investigation by larry flynt, publisher of hustler, the sex magazine, who said friday at a news conference in beverly hills, calif., that his publication had learned that livingston had had adulterous affairs during the last 10 years.", "flynt said earlier this year that he wanted to expose the `hypocrisy' of those in washington who are investigating clinton and in october offered $1 million to anyone who could prove they had had affairs with members of congress.", "he said friday that this larger investigation, to be published perhaps as soon as january, would reveal what he described as indiscretions of several other republicans.", "he said he had no connection with the white house but that he had hired an investigative firm based in washington and made up of former employees of the fbi and the cia.", "he would not confirm whether the firm is terry lenzner's investigative group inc., which has done work for the president's private lawyers.", "livingston was unavailable to reporters friday.", "he spent some time friday morning sprawled in a chair in the back of the house chamber, listening to the debate over whether to impeach clinton for lying about his own sexual indiscretions.", "several colleagues knelt at livingston's knee, whispered to him and patted him on the back.", "he spent most of the day in a private office off the chamber, avoiding the gauntlet of reporters who lay in wait for him between the house and his regular office across the street.", "the only word out of his aides was that the navy had awarded contracts worth millions of dollars for ships to be built in his louisiana district at the avondale shipyards.", "during friday's debate, a handful of democrats made only oblique allusions to human failures.", "for example, rep. john lewis, d-ga., said: `let he that has no sin cast the first stone.", "who, who among us has not sinned?'", "but no one said that livingston's disclosure or the mild democratic attempts to exploit it would influence their votes on impeachment.", "rather, on the house floor and in hallway chitchat, livingston's conduct seemed to be the last thing that either republicans or democrats wanted to talk about.", "`bob livingston is a first-rate human being,' said rep. david obey, d-wis., who has worked closely and sparred with livingston on the appropriations committee, in an interview.", "`i will repeat what the nuns taught me at st. james a long time ago: we would all be a hell of a lot better off looking after our own souls rather than trying to evaluate somebody else's.", "none of us have any business even having an opinion on it.'", "even conservative republicans seemed ready to overlook the disclosure.", "`we're not going to say, `bob, you can't be speaker because you violated your vows with your wife,' said rep. lindsey graham, r-s.c. like many, including livingston, graham distinguished livingston's conduct from clinton's by saying that the president had `trampled' on the legal system whereas livingston's behavior was strictly private.", "despite flynt's claims, many republicans blamed the clinton administration for smearing livingston, although they offered no evidence.", "`this isn't just happening on its own,' said rep. dana rohrabacher, r- calif.", "the raw passions were such that the house democrats did not to hesitate to bellow `you resign!", "you resign!'", "at speaker-elect robert livingston when he called from the house floor for president clinton to quit the white house in the face of certain impeachment.", "shockingly, stunningly, livingston did just that.", "he quit in one breathtaking utterance, as if flicking a trump card onto the heap of impeachment angst festering before his eyes in the debating chamber.", "in his one and only strategem in leading his fellow house republicans, livingston's decision struck congress like a verbal bomb.", "stunned democrats saw their fury vaporized upon the instant.", "they had to stand, almost staggering to their feet, to join the republicans in a prolonged, emotional ovation for livingston and his undeniable self-sacrifice.", "as they stood, the democrats sensed livingston had most suddenly closed a trap on the president and his defenders.", "for, with the impeachment issue set to move to the senate, livingston, whose own marital indiscretions were now before the public to his obvious misery, chose to show how the question of a political leader's resignation was very much in play in this tumult-tossed city.", "`i must set the example that i hope president clinton will follow,' livingston declared, flabbergasting all attending the impeachment debate and the nation watching beyond.", "livingston walked off the floor like the sheriff in some bullet-pocked political `high noon,' discarding the leadership badge he had wrested from the earlier speaker-casualty, newt gingrich.", "in the corridor just beyond, a doorman shouted to a police officer: `livingston just resigned!'", "`what?", "what?'", "came the reply from the officer, who obviously thought the momentous announcement would be about clinton's impeachment, not livingston's political self-immolation.", "just so, the democrats, already deep into bone-raw exhaustion after their long fight to save the president, grasped for bearings.", "`it is a surrender to a developing sexual mccarthyism!'", "declared rep. jerrold nadler, d-n.y., a leading presidential defender trying to rally democrats around the argument that livingston should not resign any more than president clinton should quit under fire.", "but the republicans were surging to the fore on the strength of livingston's announcement, fighting tears as they rose to salute him as the ultimate political role model in the grueling impeachment process as it roared into the final minutes of debate.", "`for some it is no longer good enough to make a mistake, to confirm that mistake and take the consequences of that mistake,' said tom delay, the republican whip, his hands shaking, his eyes tearing as he addressed the house and sought to drive the example of livingston all the way down pennsylvania avenue.", "`he understood what this debate was all about _ honor, duty, integrity and the truth,' said delay arguing that in one swift blow, livingston had demonstrated himself to have been a far better speaker than clinton has been a president.", "with something of the political elan the president showed in initiating the iraq attack as his own impeachment loomed, house republicans, battered in public opinion polls, had found a rocket's red glare of their own.", "`i have hurt you all deeply and beg your forgiveness,' livingston told the house, the nation and his family as he announced retreat.", "only moments before, democrats openly hissed the man as livingston firmly read his own judgment upon the president: `sir, you have done great damage to this nation over the past year.'", "presidential resignation was in order, he continued, and then came the shouts of `you resign!", "you resign!'", "and as livingston closed the circle on his career, he stunned the place into a collective breath of disbelief and somehow almost threatened to reduce the dark historic issue before the house _ the impeachment of the president _ into a matter of anticlimax.", "`they must not succeed,' david bonior, the democratic whip said of the republicans as he was given the task of refocusing the day on the misdeeds of the president, not the departure of the speaker.", "`we are here to debate impeachment and should not be distracted from that,' he declared.", "`the only way we can stop this vicious cycle,' bonior cried out from the floor, `is if we refuse to give into it, whether it is bill clinton or bob livingston.'", "but the house was still reeling through the frenzied day as the fateful vote on the presidency approached and the notion of resignation licked about the capital city like a flame in a forest.", "rep. bob livingston, who confessed to his colleagues thursday night that he had had adulterous affairs, stunned the house chamber saturday morning by saying in the impeachment debate on president clinton that he would not serve as speaker and would quit congress in six months.", "he urged the president to follow his example and quit, too.", "but at the white house, where calls for clinton's resignation are derided as a republican strategy, the president sent a spokesman into the driveway to urge livingston to reconsider his resignation.", "livingston stood in the well of the house he has served for two decades and called on clinton to resign his office rather than force a trial in the senate, drawing boos from his colleagues and cat-calls that he should quit instead.", "he then did just that.", "`i must set the example that i hope president clinton will follow,' livingston announced to a shocked and silent chamber in an act that left the republican party in total chaos just hours before the vote to impeach clinton.", "the decision also left the party leaderless on the eve of the opening of the 106th congress, when republicans must govern with one of the narrowest majorities in history.", "several republicans, including rep. tom delay of texas, the majority whip, somberly welcomed the news, suggesting it relieved them of an excruciating embarrassment.", "in lauding livingston's move, delay said, `he understood what this debate was all about _ it's about honor and decency and integrity and the truth, everything we honor in this country.'", "but democrats said they were aghast, and many _ including clinton _ called on livingston to reconsider his decision.", "`mr. livingston's resignation was wrong,' declared rep. jerrold nadler, d-n.y. `it is a surrender to a developing sexual mccarthyism.", "are we going to have a new test if someone wants to run for public office _ are you now or have you ever been an adulterer?'", "he called on the country to distinguish between sins and crimes.", "white house press secretary joe lockhart said clinton was `disappointed' at the news of livingston's plans and wished that he would reconsider.", "lockhart said the president `firmly believes that the politics of personal destruction in this town and this country has to come to an end.'", "he reaffirmed that clinton would not resign, saying: `the president is going to do what's in the best interest of the country.", "it would be wrong to give in to this insidious politics of personal destruction.'", "livingston's announced resignation was all the more stunning for its disclosure in a process that could result in the president's removal from office.", "the speaker is second in line to the presidency, after the vice president.", "newt gingrich, the outgoing speaker, who was driven from the post after republicans lost five seats in the november election, technically remains speaker until jan. 6, when livingston's election was to be ratified by the new congress.", "but gingrich has removed himself from the daily operations of the house at this extraordinary session and has begun to dismantle his office.", "livingston's decision was said to be driven in part by the anger of a group of about a dozen conservatives in his party who were disillusioned that he had withheld news of his affairs from them.", "they had threatened to withhold their votes for him in the election in january that would formally make him speaker.", "he was also concerned about the pain caused to his family by further disclosures, some members said.", "they added that, not lost on many in his party, was the example he would set for the president by offering to resign his post now.", "delay, no.", "3 in the house republican leadership, is expected to fill the power vacuum at least temporarily, in deed if not in title, while the party regroups to find a new speaker.", "many members quickly rallied around rep. dennis hastert of illinois.", "hastert, one of delay's deputy whips who is well respected among his colleagues, had been promoted as a candidate for majority leader last month, but never mounted a campaign.", "rep. dick armey of texas only precariously held on to his majority-leader post last month and was not considered a likely candidate for speaker.", "he is expected to manage the reorganization, which republican leaders have set for jan. 4. livingston met privately with his closest advisers friday as the impeachment debate unfolded.", "some of his colleagues believed he had made a mistake in disclosing thursday night _ just as the house was moving into the divisive debate over impeachment _ that he had `on occasion strayed from my marriage.'", "he told republican leaders late thursday afternoon that hustler magazine was going to expose his affairs early next year.", "some leaders urged him to keep quiet, but his wife, bonnie, encouraged him to tell his colleagues immediately, despite the momentous vote that was nearing on the floor.", "at that point thursday night, roll call, a newspaper on capitol hill, reported on its web site that livingston was going to admit to the affairs and was going to offer to resign.", "in a closed-door meeting with his fellow republicans, he did admit to the affairs but made no offer to step down, receiving three standing ovations instead.", "thursday night, livingston stated that he would `not be intimidated by these efforts' to exploit his past.", "but friday he removed himself from public action and that night drew his closest advisers into his confidence.", "his aides said saturday that they had no clue what was he was contemplating, and few other members were aware of his plans.", "asked if he had any advance word, rep. j.c. watts of oklahoma, a newly elected member of the republican leadership, said: `i had no idea.'", "asked if there had been internal party pressure on livingston to resign, rep. harold rogers, r-ky., said: `i didn't know about it if there was,' but added, `there were some members who were critical of it.'", "as the leaders tried saturday to hold the party together on and off the house floor, most republicans stuck to their prepared scripts on the floor in favor of impeaching the president.", "but some began expressing their anguish.", "rep. henry hyde, r-ill., who admitted to his own adulterous affair earlier this year, said after livingston's resignation: `those of us who are sinners must feel wretched today.", "something is going on repeatedly that has to be stopped, and that is a confusion between private acts of infidelity and public acts.'", "to much applause, hyde declared: `congress has no business intruding into private acts.'", "republicans, indeed livingston himself, had made this same distinction between clinton's sexual indiscretions and livingston's, saying that clinton lied about his private acts and therefore abused the legal system and his powers.", "as livingston said in his statement thursday: `these indiscretions were not with employees on my staff and i have never been asked to testify under oath about them.'", "democrats hoped that livingston's seemingly drastic action would wake up the house to how poisoned the atmosphere had become and might prompt republicans to reconsider the impeachment of clinton.", "rep. paul kanjorski, d-pa., said, `we are now starting to offer up sacrificial lambs to whatever terrible disease this is.'", "in a stirring speech applauded even by some republicans, rep. dick gephardt of missouri, the democratic leader, praised livingston as a `worthy, good and honorable man' and said his resignation was a grave mistake.", "`it's a terrible capitulation to the negative political forces that are consuming our political system and our country,' gephardt said, adding that the events of the last few days showed `life imitates farce.'", "`we need to stop destroying imperfect people at an unattainable altar of public morality,' he said, urging his colleagues to `step back from the abyss' and reject resignation, impeachment and `vicious self-righteousness.'", "the only thing certain now is uncertainty.", "the smart money shouts that president clinton will never resign, and he concurs.", "the smart money argues that the senate could not muster the 67 votes that would be needed to remove the wounded president from office, which would require the defection of 12 democrats if all the republicans stand against him.", "the smart money insists that someone will cut a deal to end all this.", "maybe so.", "but the smarter money whispers, `remember.'", "remember that everyone in washington, including rep. henry hyde, r-ill., chairman of the judiciary committee, said the house would never, ever, treat impeachment as a partisan issue.", "wrong.", "remember that all the pundits predicted democratic losses in the midterm elections, and when the opposite happened, they said impeachment was dead.", "twice wrong.", "and remember that in the new year the nation may travel down a road it has never traveled before.", "one other president, andrew johnson of tennessee, has been tried by the senate, of course.", "but that happened in a different country _one with only 37 states, with primitive communications, with a simple economy based largely on agriculture, with only minimal commitments abroad.", "in the toxic politics of century's end in washington, the inconceivable has become the commonplace.", "the wholly unanticipated announcement saturday morning by rep. robert livingston, r-la., that he would not serve as speaker and would resign from congress, following his equally unanticipated disclosure on thursday night of several extramarital affairs, only deepened the capital's profound sense of insecurity.", "the deadly sweep of the scythe of neo-puritanism appears unstoppable, at least for the moment, and livingston's forthcoming resignation will increase the pressure on the president to do likewise.", "`you've set before us an example,' the leader of house republican majority, rep. dick armey of texas, told livingston saturday.", "`the example is that principle comes before power.'", "the democrats made the opposite point, arguing that the livingston case showed how very wrong it was to savage people for personal pecaddillos.", "one transcendently important thing remains the same: although surrounded by judicial trappings and presided over by the chief justice, trials of presidents are political processes, with power residing in the hands of elective politicians.", "in addition to narrow legal issues of guilt or innocence, they can weigh considerations of party, the nation's future, their own individual political well-being and almost anything else they care to weigh in reaching a verdict.", "the longer they took, the more numerous the call for resignation would probably be.", "even before saturday's epochal roll-calls, four of ten americans interviewed in the latest new york times/cbs news poll said they thought the president should step down if he were to be indicted, despite the fact that a large majority voiced disapproval of the impeachment proceedings.", "what lies behind that seeming contradiction, of course, is the fear that clinton, and the country with him, would be incapacitated.", "no one took andrew johnson very seriously after he escaped conviction by a single vote.", "but clinton, a man of powerful will whose whole life has been a series of comebacks, has already embarked on an effort to show that he can do the nation's business.", "richard nixon clawed his way back to respectability after leaving the white house when no one thought he could; clinton intends to re-establish his authority while still in office.", "he has one great advantage: two-thirds of the american public continues to voice its approval of his political stewardship, whatever it thinks of him as a man.", "the president will press hard, despite his much-reduced leverage, for a deal on censure.", "indeed, in as fine a piece of political irony as one could ask for, he has already sought to enlist former sen. bob dole, the republican he defeated in 1996, as an emissary to the senate majority.", "the numbers are not unpromising: with the help of six republicans, the 45 democrats could end the trial at any time and pass a censure resolution that the house would surely take up.", "there are enough republican moderates and sometime party-buckers to make that a plausible target.", "but the republican leader in the senate, trent lott of mississippi, who has made his unwillingness to take the president's word plainly evident in recent days, is determined to fight such a trial-aborting arrangement.", "it is clear that clinton's reputation has been stained forever, no matter what the senate does.", "the spot will not out.", "history will remember this man who so coveted a glowing legacy not as an impresario of economic growth, not as the moses who pointed the way to the 21st century, but as the second president ever to be impeached, if not as the first to be ousted.", "that harsh word, `impeachment,' will cling to his name as surely as `teapot dome' clings to harding's and `depression' to hoover's.", "but he is not alone in having suffered grievous injury in the political avalanche that was shaken loose by the disclosure of clinton's sexual relationship with a former white house intern, monica lewinsky.", "the republicans' public support has shriveled to 40 percent in the new times/cbs news poll, its lowest level in 14 years, and it could go lower once the fact of impeachment sinks in.", "journalists are seen by many as jackals, indifferent to whatever personal suffering or national angst they may cause as long as they get the story, and none too concerned about accuracy.", "in fact, the whole political culture of the 1990s, with its criminalization of political conduct and its seeming indifference to important national and international issues, has fallen into disrepute with ordinary americans.", "the last week seemed to crystallize the long-term decline in political civility.", "republicans called clinton a liar, even as he was committing american pilots to the skies over iraq, and democrats accused their rivals of conducting a political lynching or a political coup d'etat.", "bipartisanship may have been the biggest victim of all.", "party lines on saturday's rolls calls held as firm as leg irons.", "almost all of the republicans who opposed impeachment did so not exclusively on legal principle but at least partly because of special political circumstances _ the democratic majority in rep. constance morella's district in the maryland suburbs of washington, for example, and the gratitude of rep. peter king, r-n.y., for clinton's peacemaking in ireland.", "it is hard to see who has emerged from it with reputation enhanced, except perhaps hillary rodham clinton, staunch in the face of deception.", "if some of the threats and dire predictions uttered by house democrats in recent days are to be taken at face value, the nation is entering upon an era of bad feelings, the polar opposite of a second era of good feelings, similar to that of the 1820s, that clinton had hoped to preside over.", "rep. tom sawyer, d-ohio, compared clinton on friday to sir thomas more, executed for treason in 1535 because of his religious beliefs.", "he quoted more's words as an admonition for today: `what you have hunted me for is not my actions but for the thoughts of my heart.", "it is a long road you have opened.", "god help the statesmen who walk your road.'", "but amidst all the loose talk about permanent damage to this institution or that, remember: things change with startling speed in modern american politics, and the institutions of american government have proved extraordinarily resilient.", "president nixon, it was almost universally agreed in 1974, had weakened the american presidency for many decades to come.", "nobody said that after eight years under ronald reagan, and that was only 15 years later.", "the new york times said in an editorial for sunday, dec. 20: the republicans' drive for a partisan impeachment based soley on party-line voting power rather than any sense of proportion produced an unexpected sideshow in the resignation of rep. bob livingston from his role as future speaker of the house.", "analysts on both sides of the struggle over president clinton's future will point to livingston's downfall as evidence of a generalized breakdown in legislative civility on capitol hill.", "democrats will see a moral symmetry, depicting livingston as a victim of the sexual puritanism he was wielding against clinton.", "but the one thing that no one should fall for is livingston's invitation to use his resignation as a model for resolving the crisis at the white house.", "livingston's statement rocked congress, but it should not shake the foundations of the somber constitutional process now underway.", "by lying under oath, clinton made it necessary for the house to consider impeachment.", "the evidence convinced most americans that the president should be censured, but not removed from office.", "livingston allowed gop partisans to block censure in the house.", "the result is that after saturday's expected impeachment vote, after livingston's unexpected announcement, the mission of the senate remains the same.", "it must resist those republicans who want to short-circuit the constitutional process with demands for resignation, and it must use the upcoming senate trial as a forum for finding a censure commensurate with the president's personal dishonesty and offenses against the law.", "these require stern punishment but not removal from office.", "in undertaking this work, the senate must also reassure the american people that a decisive wisdom at the core of our messy-looking political system has not melted down.", "in such distempered times, this is a shining opportunity for the senate.", "its members pride themselves on being the republic's fire wall against presidential excess and the popular or partisan passions that sometimes seize the house of representatives.", "no one can predict whether senate majority leader trent lott will rise to the defining challenge of his career or whether he will surrender to the mean streak he acquired during 16 grumpy years as a minority member of the house.", "we would like to see lott reach for a starring role in history.", "lott's growling response to questions about censure is not encouraging.", "he may be right that the constitution requires him to convene a trial, but nothing in that document prevents him from speedily guiding the senate toward censure negotiations.", "indeed, a simple majority vote _ 45 democrats plus 6 cooperating republicans _ can end the senate trial at any time, clearing the way for introduction of the kind of censure resolution suggested by former sen. bob dole.", "in an intriguing report on nbc, tim russert described discussions among a bipartisan group of senators about a censure that would involve some form of presidential confession, a fine and a joint congressional request that independent counsel kenneth starr not prosecute clinton in the courts.", "if lott refuses to allow a bipartisan search for censure, the burden will fall upon respected members like joseph lieberman on the democratic side and orrin hatch for the republicans.", "through cooperation, they can guide the senate toward a punishment that fixes clinton in history as a president who lied under oath, but avoids the taint of partisan vengeance associated with the house impeachment vote.", "the senate's historic reputation for prudence requires it to find appropriate punishment for a personally weak president who has damaged the rule of law, but not threatened the stability of the government.", "rejecting a last-minute democratic attempt to soften its action to censure, the house of representatives moved to impeach president william jefferson clinton for perjury on saturday and to call on the senate to try him, convict him and remove him from office.", "but even before the vote, republicans pressed another line of attack, demanding clinton's resignation.", "rep. robert livingston, nominated for speaker last month by his party, startled the house when he announced he would not run for speaker and would resign from the house after 21 years of service.", "he urged the president to `heal the wounds that you have created.", "you, sir, may resign your post.'", "angry democrats booed and shouted, `you resign!'", "livingston continued, `i can only challenge you in such fashion if i am willing to heed my own words.'", "apologizing again

background.", "as tv screens toted up the numbers of the electronically-cast vote, members of congress milled around and chatted on the floor.", "even the brief democratic walkout after a motion to consider censure was defeated was thoroughly forecast.", "as the democrats straggled down the steps of congress, it looked curiously undramatic on television, though it probably made a better still

five days to go before gubernatorial runoffs on sunday, neither he nor president fernando henrique cardoso, in brasilia, said how the government planned to achieve the savings.", "important allies of

package that cardoso was to discuss with congressional party leaders on wednesday morning.", "in brasilia, officials said that among the measures being considered were a tax increase on financial transactions, to three-tenths of a percent from two-tenths of a percent, and extending the fiscal stabilization fund, which sets aside 20 percent of all taxes collected for presidential discretionary spending.", "the fund was to have expired by 1999. speaking in washington, parente said that brazil would aim toward a surplus of 2.6 percent in 1999, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3 percent in 2001. it had

aid or loan guarantees, have yet to be negotiated.", "but several congressional leaders have been alerted to the likelihood that the administration would have to act while congress is in recess.", "this early warning from the administration reflects memories of how congress erupted with objections and hearings in 1995 when president clinton committed $20 billion in u.s. funds to the bailout of mexico.", "but administration officials said last week that their early soundings indicate that members of congress are deeply concerned about preventing an economic collapse in latin america that would resound in the united states, and thus they expect few objections.", "the timing of an aid package for brazil _ originally expected within the next few days _ is complicated by unexpected delays that have cropped up in dealing with the brazilian government.", "the government of president fernando henrique cardoso faces politically risky gubernatorial elections on sunday, which may well determine whether brazil can execute an austerity program that is the key condition for the loans it is concurrently negotiating with the international monetary fund.", "the biggest role in the rescue program for brazil will be taken by the international monetary fund, which said last week that it would contribute at least $15 billion _ and appears to be under pressure from the united states to do even more.", "another $9 billion or so will come from the world bank and the inter-american development bank, and the remainder from the united states and other major industrial nations.", "germany and japan, though, have been reluctant to take part, one u.s. official noted, suggesting that latin america is chiefly washington's problem, not their own.", "so far, u.s. officials working behind the scenes to organize the aid package have said nothing in public about the details of plans for a direct contribution to brazil.", "`brazil is very important to the economic well-being of the region, the united states and the international community, and all of us are very much focused on seeing how we can be helpful,' treasury secretary robert rubin said on friday.", "but in a wide-ranging interview about the global economic turmoil, rubin declined to say what strategy he would pursue in dealing with brazil's problems and insisted that no decisions had been made about how the united states might contribute.", "but he discussed brazil as an opportunity to engage in the kind of preventive financial diplomacy that president clinton advocated in speeches to the imf and the world bank here three weeks ago.", "at the time, clinton argued that the monetary fund should `provide contingent finance to help countries ward off global financial contagion' rather than wait for disaster to strike.", "direct u.s. aid to brazil would clearly send a symbolic message: that after a year of trying to manage the financial crisis through the monetary fund, the united states is now ready to put a limited amount of its own capital at risk to prevent further havoc _ not only for brazil but to stop chaos spreading to argentina, mexico and other countries that are major u.s. trading partners.", "that would be a change of strategy.", "so far, the united states has operated almost entirely through international financial institutions, chiefly the imf but it would also be a risky move for president clinton, economically and politically.", "even though congress objected to the $20 billion in u.s. funds committed to the bailout of mexico, it turned out that only $12 billion was ultimately needed, and it has since been paid back, with interest.", "but rubin noted on friday that `it's a very different environment now.'", "other administration officials say they believe that there would be few objections in congress to direct u.s. participation in a brazil bailout.", "`i think there are a lot more people in congress who are now scared to death by what's been happening in the markets, and what could happen in their own districts,' a white house official said last week, `and they won't say much as long as they don't have to vote on it.'", "by acting soon to stabilize latin america, the administration is hoping to capitalize on two weeks of relative calm after the late-summer panic that engulfed russia and, at its height, led to an outflow of a billion dollars a day from brazil, for fear that it would be the next country forced to devalue its currency.", "whether this calm marks the beginning of a turnaround or just another pause in the wildfires that have erupted since thailand's currency crisis in july 1997 is a matter of considerable debate.", "but many experts cite the confluence of several events that have reassured jittery investors around the world: two successive interest-rate cuts in the united states, japan's long-delayed move to prop up its banking system with $500 billion in taxpayer funds, and a steady strengthening of currencies in thailand, indonesia and south korea, the first signs that investors may be preparing to return.", "always circumspect when it comes to commenting publicly on markets, rubin acknowledged that `in the last several weeks there have been a number of significant, positive developments.'", "but the former trader, burned during a 26-year career by many false market rallies, warned that `serious issues remain' and that `it will take some time for the world to work its way out' of what he has repeatedly called `the most serious international financial disruption of the last 50 years.'", "in fact, rubin's aides are clearly nervous about the possibility of another outbreak that could set off a new round of panic, which has made it virtually impossible for many emerging-market countries to borrow money on world markets.", "`brazil and japan are the two obvious tinderboxes,' said jeffrey garten, dean of the yale school of management, who served as undersecretary of commerce for international affairs during clinton's first term.", "`in brazil, the issue is whether the package that is coming together will really be big enough to deal with an exploding debt problem.", "and in japan the question is whether there is real reform that goes along with the money.'", "but after spending 18 months in negotiations with the japanese, rubin clearly senses that the united states has little leverage in tokyo; its problems are chiefly rooted in political gridlock, not lack of resources.", "in brazil, though, the united states has a better chance of buying time and influencing an economic reform program, as long as it does not appear to be dictating terms publicly to cardoso and his team.", "but demonstrating economic support will probably require tapping the exchange stabilization fund, created during the roosevelt administration to help stabilize the dollar.", "the money is under rubin's control, with presidential approval, and he reached into it to circumvent congressional objections to aiding mexico in 1995. but the reaction was so strong _ for a time congress restricted tapping the fund for international bailouts _ that rubin has been extraordinarily cautious ever since.", "he committed $3 billion in a `second line of defense' in emergency aid programs for indonesia and south korea last year, but no money was ultimately dispersed to either country.", "u.s. officials said that south korea did not need the extra help, and that the collapse of the suharto government in indonesia so changed the political scene there that it would be too risky to offer direct u.s. aid.", "in the bailout of russia _ whose economy collapsed after president boris yeltsin abandoned an agreement to reform the economy and dismissed the leading reformers _ the united states offered no direct help.", "those events set off a panicked exit by investors from all emerging markets, and greatly worsened brazil's troubles.", "so far, brazilian officials have successfully calmed the market by constantly talking about a forthcoming aid program from the imf, convincing speculators that it would be dangerous to bet against the country.", "but at the same time, the brazilian officials have maintained the pose that they do not really need the cash _ and are certainly in no hurry to get it.", "u.s. officials and top officials of the imf are clearly nervous, worried that the longer the negotiations drag on, the greater will be the risk of brazil being caught in another round of market turmoil.", "`the brazilians want everyone to think that it's all under

rates to more than 50 percent, choking off credit for most companies.", "meanwhile, the country is slipping into recession.", "the aid would buy time for the brazilians, but it is contingent on

condemnatory signs.", "after an impromptu shopping trip, during which he was greeted with shouts of `we love you,' clinton told some donors at the beginning of an impassioned reprise of his cleveland speech: `i didn't even mind the protesters, that's the american way.'", "but, he added, he preferred it when they were in the minority, `and that seemed to be the case.'", "as he rode into cleveland,

important clues suggesting how clinton's problems are influencing the conduct of races around the country.", "many democrats are straddling a line that seems to shift a bit with every new scandal-related disclosure: they do not want to appear close to a president whose conduct embarrasses them, and yet, sensing the possibility of a public backlash against republicans, they are weighing their words carefully and are wary of hopping on any impeachment bandwagon.", "and while publicly these democrats express confidence that the scandal will have little impact on them, their campaigns are preparing for the worst by placing greater emphasis than ever on behind-the-efforts to prod their core constituencies to vote.", "in a reflection of the uncertainty that the clinton scandal has cast even among republicans, the challengers in the price and carson districts _ both are political novices seeking office for the first time _ have differing strategies: tom roberg, a computer executive in raleigh who is taking on price, has broadcast a television commercial exploiting the scandal.", "`tom roberg has called for bill clinton's resignation,' the narrator says.", "`this is not the time to be silent, price.", "where do you stand?'", "but in indianapolis, gary hofmeister, a conservative jeweler challenging mrs. carson in indiana's 10th congressional district, is taking a more subtle approach: rather than mention the scandal directly, he notes as often as he can that `julia votes with clinton almost 100 percent of the time.'", "asked why he was not much raising the scandal directly, hofmeister said: `don't murder somebody when they're in the process of committing suicide.", "there would be a danger if we went overboard.'", "the best evidence of the discomfort of both price and mrs. carson is that when asked in separate interviews whether they would want clinton to campaign in their districts, both said it would be impossible at this late date for the white house to schedule a visit.", "what if there was a sudden schedule change?", "both paused, squirmed a bit and mustered answers that were hardly affirmative.", "`given the president's popularity, i doubt it will hurt me,' mrs. carson said.", "and price?", "`i don't think that would be such a good idea,' he said.", "`i've never had a president campaign here, and i wouldn't want to start this time'

further complicated by anecdotal evidence that runs counter to democratic fears and republican hopes.", "in three days of campaign stops here in north carolina and in indianapolis, the scandal was rarely raised by any voter being courted by the candidates of either party.", "when a reporter asked about it, many voters said that as appalled as they were at clinton's behavior, they had a hard time relating it to their decision on which way to vote in the congressional elections in five weeks.", "as hofmeister walked through the parking lot outside a gun and knife show at the indiana national guard armory in indianapolis last sunday, billy derringer, a 57-year-old machinist who is retired on disability, called him over to express outrage about the millions of dollars that had been spent to investigate clinton.", "`it's pathetic to spend all of our money,' said derringer, who identified himself as an independent.", "`it shouldn't have gotten this far.'", "hofmeister tried his best to make the republicans' case.", "`there has to be rule of law,' he said.", "mrs. carson said she hoped that democrats and swing voters alike would become so fed up with the lewinsky inquiry that the issue might even help her.", "to that end, she proudly informs audiences that she voted against making public the report delivered to the house by kenneth starr, the whitewater independent counsel.", "`i was one of 63 members of congress who voted against putting all that filth on the internet,' she said, adding that starr's inquiry had been `a cruel hoax in terms of fiscal responsibility and accountability.'", "the carson campaign is counting on voters like timothy daly, a 38-year-old real estate executive who voted for a republican two years ago but now favors mrs. carson.", "`i'm pulling the democratic ticket because i'm tired of it: the right side of the republican party is playing politics,' daly said.", "`we'd like to see them go on with the people's business.'", "back here in the 4th district, price has some reasons to be worried.", "he was first elected to the house in 1986 but, as a four-term incumbent, was ousted in the republican sweep of 1994 (only to win his seat back two years later).", "in addition, the district was redrawn last year to include a large durham section where voters do not know him well.", "determined not to be a midterm casualty of clinton once again, price says he is waging the most vigorous get-out-the-vote ground campaign of his career.", "rather than engage roberg over the clinton scandal, price has begun broadcasting a television commercial that emphasizes his central issue: education.", "the congressman's advisers say they intentionally produced an advertisement that appears decidedly nonpolitical _ it features school children in a play _ in an effort to break through the television clutter about the scandal.", "but the price campaign also has a weapon it is holding in reserve, in the event roberg appears to be riding the clinton scandal to advantage: the incumbent's advisers say they would not be timid about running commercials underscoring that he earned a divinity degree before getting his doctorate in political science.", "at a coffee with voters in a wealthy enclave of raleigh the other night, roberg opened his remarks by asserting that clinton had `lost the moral authority to lead.'", "yet none of those assembled asked him about the scandal; they were more concerned about the state's plans to build a highway near their neighborhood.", "it was a surprising scene three months ago when dennis rivera, one of new york city's most left-leaning labor leaders, was singing the praises of sen. alfonse m. d'amato.", "rivera, president of the largest union in new york city, praised d'amato for persuading trent lott, the senate majority leader, to support legislation that financed health coverage for hundreds of thousands of uninsured children.", "it looked as

national health and human service employees union, endorsed rep. charles e. schumer, d-n.y., and thereby risked d'amato's wrath.", "the endorsement is risky, labor leaders acknowledge, because angering this powerful senator could make him far less responsive to labor's needs when unions turn to him for help in the future if he is re-elected.", "although it may seem illogical, two words go far to explain why rivera's union backed schumer: monica lewinsky.", "largely as a result of the lewinsky scandal, democrats say they suddenly fear that the republicans will gain a filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority in the senate, where the republicans have 55 seats to the democrats' 45. for labor leaders like rivera, the notion of a strong republican majority is a nightmare.", "that fear has helped push other new york unions into schumer's column, even though d'amato had long courted them.", "those unions include the teamsters' joint council in new york city and district council 37, an umbrella group representing 120,000 municipal employees.", "labor leaders say they fear that with a filibuster-proof republican majority, the senate would push through anti-union legislation, like recently defeated republican proposals to curb labor's political spending and cut financing for the national labor relations board.", "`we are worried about legislation that will not allow the labor movement to survive into the next century,' rivera said.", "alarmed that the democrats will lose senate seats in california, illinois, wisconsin, nevada and south carolina, rivera's union concluded that it was worth backing schumer.", "the decision, rivera emphasized repeatedly, was not personal but was based on national considerations.", "`unfortunately, the leadership of the republican party at the national level in the person of newt gingrich and trent lott are not necessarily from the same culture as the republicans of the northeast,' he said.", "`they're far more conservative, far more anti-labor, far more anti-worker, far more pro-business.", "we fear that the democratic party faces irrelevance in the united states senate if we go below 41 seats.'", "trying to avoid a rupture with d'amato, rivera praised him as `an effective senator.'", "the endorsement could be a boon for schumer.", "rivera's union and the teachers' union have labor's strongest political operations in new york.", "in addition, schumer will get thousands of dollars from the local as well as use of its renowned phone banks, which can make 50,000 political calls a day.", "a spokesman for d'amato said, `al d'amato's proud that he's been endorsed by over 100 union federations and locals, representing more that 400,000 working men and women, and he'll continue his efforts on behalf of working middle class families.'", "his labor endorsements include the new york city patrolmen's benevolent association and the new york state building and construction trades council.", "besides the backing of 1199, schumer also received the endorsement of 1199's parent union, the service employees international union, which has 350,000 members in new york state.", "rivera _ who did not support d'amato the last time he ran either _ announced the endorsements during the founding convention of the new york state council of the service employees union.", "the convention packed town hall, and the new group aims to make the service employees a power to be reckoned with by bringing together a dozen union locals to forge a common political and legislative strategy.", "earlier this year, 1199 merged with the service employees, and as part of that agreement, rivera became head of the service employees in new york state.", "it was not a voice mail message that dr. marilyn rymer, a neurologist in kansas city, mo., would routinely delete, even as a registered democrat.", "`speaker newt gingrich's office,' it said, was calling to discuss a `national leadership award.'", "dr. rymer has won acclaim as

an elite committee to advise gingrich on legislation.", "too good to be true?", "well, dr. rymer would have to pay her own way if the committee should actually meet, and as an honorary committee chairman, she discovered, she would be a member of a committee composed entirely of honorary chairmen.", "and oh, the speaker wanted a donation of $500 to $1,000 to `help our efforts,' according to a transcript of a similar chat with another doctor, to elect a bigger republican majority in the house of representatives.", "with the approach of the midterm elections next month, it turns out that the national republican congressional committee, which supports candidates for the house, has been sponsoring similar calls to tens of thousands of small-business owners, including doctors.", "with this

raising, one they call akin to the practices of marketing companies like the publishers' clearing house that hook consumers with visions of million-dollar windfalls to induce them to subscribe to

effect among some democrats.", "`that's the problem,' said stuart rothenberg, the editor of an independent political newsletter in washington.", "`it's not that we don't know, and that the politicians don't know, where the general public stands on impeachment.", "the problem is that we don't know where the electorate stands on impeachment.'", "and asking voters to think ahead to an impeachment proceeding as they cast their ballots in a senate race is, in the words of stuart stevens, a republican consultant, `a double bank-shot.'", "such strategies, he said, tend to work only with a small number of single-minded or sophisticated voters.", "against that complicated backdrop, the prevailing thinking is that the use of the impeachment issue will vary from race to race, state to state and week to week, depending on the circumstances of the candidates and the composition of the electorate.", "if democrats try to turn the image of clinton in the dock to their advantage, it would be in states with a democratic edge or with sizable numbers of black voters, who overwhelmingly support the president.", "in contests like those, it might well prove to be in the interest of a democratic candidate to, as one consultant put it, sit down in front of a camera and tape an advertisement in which the candidate denounces the president's behavior but solemnly pledges to vote against impeachment.", "strategists in both parties believe that kind of approach could prove effective.", "`this is an issue where there is a huge disconnect between the elites and the public,' said fred

candidates to stress clinton's misdeeds and stay away from talk of impeachment.", "the last thing the party wants is to turn the senate elections into a referendum on whether clinton should be forced

to their candidates.", "`when and if that matter comes to the senate, i will decide on the facts that are presented to me at that time,' d'amato said.", "`it would be very premature for me to suggest

the impeachment investigation, virtually embraced the issue.", "in a live telecast of the hearings, he said the president deserved a lesser punishment, such as censure or reprimand.", "and schumer

province between march and october and has now lulled into an uneasy truce.", "indeed, the conflict between serbian forces bent on keeping kosovo in serbia and guerrillas fighting for the independence

the delijajs, ranging from the paralyzed patriarch, fazli, 94, who was burned in his bed, to the slaughter of valmir, 18 months, who was found shot, is the most thoroughly documented so far.", "human rights watch, a new york-based group, believes the knowledge gathered so far increases the possibility of prosecutions by the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague, netherlands.", "the hague's

shallow graves in the clan's nearby compound.", "in other kosovo massacres, bodies had been moved from the sites before they were seen by independent observers.", "further, family members who survived

sometimes house to house, even room to room _ took an unusually heavy toll among the serbs, said maloku, a former officer in the yugoslav army.", "he said he believed that it was those deaths the serbs avenged with the massacre of the delijajs.", "in other major attacks during the conflict, the guerrillas generally found an escape hatch.", "in obrinje, led by another former officer of the yugoslav army whom maloku declined to name, the guerrillas fought, using land mines and rocket-propelled grenades.", "maloku said he knew from a report made by rebel headquarters that at least 47

themselves resort to vile methods of struggle on the basis that the means justified the end.'", "there are probably few subjects that get south africans more excited than the issue of the truth commission and whether it is a worthy cause or a waste of money.", "the events of the last few days have only added to the debate.", "for some, like pal martins, 34, a former member of the anc's armed wing, the fact all sides of the political spectrum are in an uproar is a good thing.", "`the mere fact that everyone is complaining means that the truth commission has done its work,' he said.", "but

violations of human rights was committed by the former state through its security and law-enforcement agencies.", "moreover, the south african state in the period from the late 1970's to early 1990's

not by direct members of the a.n.c.", "or those operating under its formal command, but by civilians who saw themselves as a.n.c.", "supporters.", "in this regard, the commission finds that the

dozens of people it believes were up to their elbows in the gore but never applied for amnesty.", "so the prosecutions should begin soon, right?", "not so fast.", "the study was barely in the hands of president nelson mandela before talk of new amnesty deals had begun.", "it seems that nearly all of south africa's political parties _ including the ruling african national congress _ have key officials who could end up in the dock because of the report.", "suddenly, there is lots of talk about how the country can't withstand a round of politically divisive trials, and many political

too late, however, to press for more.", "today's south africa has urgent new problems to deal with _ unemployment, crime, white flight, too few schools and hospitals.", "so it may wind up settling for a more pragmatic reconciliation _ one that gives amnesty to the unrepentant simply because it's more practical for all concerned to move on.", "in recent years, truth commissions have gained popularity in many places, notably chile, argentina and el salvador.", "but south africa's _ the biggest and most powerful, able to grant amnesty and to subpoena witnesses _ was supposed to be the real test.", "certainly the commission forced the nation to see the gruesome details of its past, as sobbing survivors and stone-faced torturers told of smashed genitals and near suffocations.", "and

amnesty.", "to be sure, there will be opposition to any proposals to limit prosecutions.", "more than a dozen human rights and victims advocacy groups have already banded together to condemn such

state to a non-racial democracy.", "during the talks, the white national party government pushed for a blanket amnesty, and the anc refused.", "in the end, only about 250 former police officers came forward, most of them foot soldiers.", "and only two high national party officials, former law and order minister adriaan vlok and police commissioner johan van der merwe, confessed _ to roles in

officials are dubious that a conspiracy exists to kill doctors who perform abortions.", "they came up empty handed when reno ordered the first federal inquiry in 1994 after the killing of a florida doctor and his bodyguard.", "the justice department conducted a two-year grand jury investigation; agents pursued some anti-abortion activists using surveillance teams.", "but investigators never found a specific plot against abortion clinics and staff members.", "violence at abortion clinics is only part of the problem.", "the fbi has in recent years found itself thrown into a minefield of

investigators to find a `reasonable indication' that a group is planning to break the law before they can open an inquiry into an organization.", "before the authorities can use such intrusive tactics as wiretapping or property searches, they must have specific evidence.", "yet fbi agents throughout the country have quietly evaluated the threat posed by a variety of extremist groups through its links to local authorities and informal interviews with the leaders of some groups.", "their conclusion is that most of these groups pose little real danger.", "much more difficult to investigate are lone terrorists inflamed by the oratory of extremist ideology but who belong to no group, drifting along society's frayed margins, `off the grid,' as some agents describe it, without the usual ties to family, friends or work.", "the profile fits eric robert rudolph, the fugitive wanted for bombings at the atlanta olympics, a gay nightclub and two abortion clinics.", "he has kept his beliefs mostly to himself, although acquaintances hint that he was familiar with religious extremism and hate groups.", "in contrast, james charles kopp, who is being sought as a material witness in the killing of

groups.'", "everyone who knew dr. barnett slepian knew that the slight, graying physician endured a measure of stress that would exhaust, even break, most people.", "there were the strangers who pawed through the garbage cans at his home and growled `murderer' as they passed him in the grocery store aisle.", "demonstrators assailed his pregnant patients as they arrived at his office for their checkups, calling him a baby killer.", "outside the clinic where he performed abortions two days a week, pickets shouted epithets like `pig' to his face.", "slepian, an obstetrician and gynecologist by training and an abortion doctor by principle, rarely acknowledged the strain.", "he might crack an occasional joke at the expense of the protesters who shadowed him at work and on weekends.", "then he would do something unexpected, like invite an anti-abortion leader to breakfast or stop and chat with a familiar demonstrator outside the clinic.", "so when he was killed oct. 23 by a sniper's bullet fired through the kitchen window of his home in the buffalo, n.y., suburbs, a furtive execution that fit a pattern of four earlier attacks on abortion providers in western new york state and canada, friends and relatives wondered not so much that slepian's work could arouse such murderous violence.", "he had predicted as much himself.", "instead, they wondered, once again, that he persisted in that work, long after other buffalo doctors had surrendered to the pressure of abortion opponents.", "`he was an incredibly fatalistic person who thought that if your number's up, it's up, and there is nothing you can do about it,' said h. amanda robb, the doctor's 32-year-old niece.", "`and he was incredibly stubborn.", "he said that women had a right to comprehensive health care

wounded 17 at abortion clinics around the nation.", "to his tormentors, he was simply an abortion doctor.", "to members of the abortion rights movement, he was a martyr for their cause.", "but slepian was far from either.", "in interviews with friends and family members, he emerges as more than a one-dimensional abstract _ a conservative who advocated old-fashioned values like self-reliance, a shy man who had rare flashes of anger, a doctor who performed abortions but had no more patience for women who had multiple abortions than for women who had multiple children they did not want or could not support.", "he was killed because he performed a medical procedure that has become emotional and politicized.", "yet there is nothing in his life to suggest he was a crusader in either politics or medicine.", "rather, he was an obstinate, unassuming man who did a remarkable thing.", "out of contrariness and out of conscience, say those who knew him, he refused to allow anyone to dictate what kind of doctor he should be, and for that, he paid with his life.", "the clues to slepian's flinty brand of commitment lie, in part, in his upbringing.", "his was a family that took success for granted even as it teetered on the edge of poverty.", "to earn money for medical school, he shoveled muck at a ranch and drove a taxi.", "he made few friends, but those he had were friends for life.", "when their wives were sick, he called repeatedly.", "when they were lonely, he flew to their side.", "slepian, who was known as bart, used to tell people that he chose obstetrics because it is a specialty that exposes a doctor to the least suffering, and that he performed abortions because it was legal and the alternatives were so much worse.", "slepian often expressed exasperation over women who came to him for abortion after abortion.", "`don't they get it?'", "his clinic staff recall him saying more than once.", "he had the same impatience for women like those he remembered from his residency in inner-city buffalo, who had child after child and no means of support.", "`he had the contempt for that of somebody who had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and made it in the world,' ms. robb said.", "he believed that to ban abortions or, just as shameful in his view, to stop teaching young doctors how to perform them, would not correct the human imperfections that he found so irritating.", "`there are 1.5 million abortions performed in this country,' his niece said, `and he just felt we're not equipped to handle 1.5 million unwanted children.'", "when he was killed, at the age of 52, bart slepian owned an imposing red brick home in the quiet suburb of amherst, complete with a swimming pool with piped-in music and an assortment of the time-saving gadgets he adored.",

all five of his sons into harvard at a time when few jews met the university's blue-blood standards.", "his father, in turn, decreed that his own three sons would be doctors or earn ph.d's.", "`we

got a b, you got yelled at.'", "the family's means did not match its expectations.", "slepian's father, philip, had joined his own father's business manufacturing leather soles for shoes.", "soon after bart was born in 1946 in boston, the company failed, so to save money, the father moved his family of six to his in-laws' apartment in mckeesport, pa., and then to rochester, n.y. once settled,

stories for small-town newspapers.", "he sold articles by the hundreds, and was still writing until his death nine years ago at the age of 93. the success that was expected of bart slepian did not

university of denver, where he majored in zoology.", "rejected by medical schools in the united states _ the fate of two out of three applicants in the late 1960s _ he studied one year in belgium and

comers at arm-wrestling and pool.", "`bart had certain beliefs, strongly held,' said richard schwarz, an old classmate who is an internist on long island.", "`he always said you shouldn't sit around

assistant at the local veterans administration hospital.", "after graduation, he moved to buffalo for his medical residency.", "there he married lynne breitbart, a registered nurse 10 years his junior, and scraped together the money to buy an obstetrics practice from a doctor who was about to retire.", "he had a soothing, unhurried manner.", "when a patient of his, patti durlak, was

capitol hill to advocates of abortion rights.", "but the future of the measure was in doubt because it was attached to a spending bill that includes a controversial provision regarding the federal election commission.", "that provision could scuttle the spending bill, which would finance the treasury department and the postal service and which still must be approved by the house and senate.", "the contraceptive measure would require the federal health plans, which affect 1.2 million female federal employees who are of child-bearing age, to cover the five methods of contraception that have been approved by the food and drug administration for use in this country _ birth control pills, diaphragms, inter-uterine devices, norplant and depo-provera.", "currently, only 19 percent of federal health plans cover those methods.", "the house and senate approved the contraceptive measure earlier this year.", "but the opponents of abortion were furious about the approval and persuaded republican leaders to have negotiators reopen discussion on the matter.", "the cost of contraceptives has driven up the out-of-pocket cost of health care for women.", "and many male members of congress seemed persuaded to support coverage of contraceptives for women, since almost all of the 285 federal health plans cover viagra, the male impotency drug.", "thursday, with pressure building to resolve the spending bills before oct. 9, when temporary financing of the government expires, the negotiators agreed to include the contraceptive measure in their conference report on the $13.4 billion bill for the treasury department and postal service.", "rep. nita lowey, d-n.y., who pushed the contraceptive measure through the house, hailed thursday's agreement as the first major accomplishment by abortion rights advocates since the republicans took control of congress in 1994. she said the negotiators had agreed to include the measure because in an election year they did not want to be perceived as opposing contraception or be seen as rejecting a measure that had passed both the house and senate.", "but many democrats said the were upset that the bill contains a provision that is seen as interfering with the independence of the federal election commission.", "that provision would require a four-vote majority among the seven federal election commissioners every four years to retain the general counsel and staff director.", "the provision is aimed at getting rid of lawrence noble, the current general counsel, who has investigated the campaign finance practices of groups like the christian coalition.", "the contraceptive measure is one of four related matters that have helped stall four spending bills.", "the three other bills that are stalled in part because of abortion-related matters include the agriculture bill, in which there is a dispute over whether the federal food and drug administration should use taxpayer money to approve drugs like ru-486, which induce abortions.", "the foreign operations bill is also stalled over whether to finance international family planning programs that may also promote abortion, while the labor and health bill is delayed because of a provision that would block access of minors to contraception.", "addressing the measure on insurance coverage for contraceptives, helen alvarez, a spokeswoman for the national conference of catholic bishops, said that the bill was bad policy.", "she said contraception had failed to stem the number of abortions, teen-age pregnancies or out-of-wedlock births.", "`public-relations-wise, it's a good tactic for them,' she conceded, `but in terms of social policy, this is a failure.'", "voting mainly on party lines on a question that has become a touchstone in the debate over development and preservation of wilderness, the senate on thursday approved a gravel road through remote wildlife habitat in alaska.", "the road, barely 30 miles long, would slice across the edge of a wildlife refuge and wilderness area on the aleutian peninsula, where it would connect an isolated village called king cove to a long-range air strip in the town of cold bay.", "without the road, its backers say, about 700 residents of king cove must continue to use unreliable air and boat service in emergencies, often risking dangerous winds and seas as they seek medical evacuation to anchorage.", "opponents of the road call the project an unjustifiable precedent that threatens the seasonal breeding grounds of protected migratory birds, and they say that improved air or sea service would be a better alternative.", "the vote thursday, 59-38, was a victory for the state's congressional delegation.", "but with president clinton likely to veto the measure, the final outcome may depend on whether its sponsors can insert the road proposal into a huge spending bill that is likely to emerge just before congress heads home for the nov. 3 elections.", "three republicans voted against the bill, and six democrats voted for it.", "the clinton administration has repeatedly warned that it will veto a big spending bill if it contains an array of anti-environmental provisions that are under consideration.", "indeed, the white house seems to be itching for a partisan fight over environmental priorities.", "but while many republicans in congress still appear reluctant to engage in that broad fight, they were willing thursday to cast their lot with the senate's two powerful alaskans, ted stevens and frank murkowski, both republicans.", "a companion bill in the house, sponsored by rep. don young of alaska, also a republican, has not come to the floor.", "even sen. john chafee of rhode island, a leader of republican environmentalists, voted for the road.", "last february chafee's staff had assembled a score of environmental lobbyists in his office to plan strategy for opposing the road, environmental advocates said thursday.", "they speculated that the senator had changed his position out of deference to the power of stevens, who as chairman of the appropriations committee exerts tremendous influence at a time when a dozen spending bills are in their final stages.", "a chafee aide said chafee voted reluctantly for the road after alaska's senators convinced him of its merits.", "stevens said in angry tones thursday that two-thirds of alaska's land was off limits to development and that vital health services were being denied to his state's residents.", "`we can't use it without permission from some bureaucrat who is compelled by extreme environmentalists,' he said.", "`they are so extreme that they say this 330,000-acre izembek refuge, the smallest wilderness in alaska, is so sacrosanct that it can't move its border 60 feet.'", "but sen. dale bumpers, d-ark., called the road project a dangerous precedent.", "`building a road through a wilderness in alaska, no matter how short or how long, would be the

early departure, compared with the last three nights, should not be interpreted as a sign of crisis or of imminent peace in the budget talks.", "sunday's discussions focused on education and president clinton's request for $1.1 billion to hire 100,000 teachers, but aides said the bargainers did not delve into much detail and nothing was resolved.", "`i think we made some real progress today, but we still have a significant difference in the area of education,' said erskine bowles, clinton's chief of staff and top negotiator, after sunday's meeting.", "`we're going to try to plow through that over the next two days.'", "asked how far apart the two sides were on education, rep. dick armey of texas, the republican majority leader, replied: `i don't know.", "we're not together.'", "he said the two sides had made `some progress, but not enough.'", "the talks came during another day of escalated political confrontation as congressional democrats and republicans, painfully aware that they have three weeks until election day, tried to take advantage of the static budget situation.", "congress has passed only six of the 13 required spending bills and are negotiating now with the white house on a final omnibus package that will contain the remaining seven bills and major issues including how to conduct the census in the year 2000, how much money to provide the international monetary fund and under what conditions it should be provided, and how much emergency money to provide for items like increased security at u.s. embassies around the world and for american farmers.", "also to be resolved are a host of issues that have little to do with financing and more to do with ideology, including environmental matters, contraception and national student testing.", "republicans said the president had been disengaged from the process, and they were irked at what they said was his swooping in at the 11th hour and pushing his education agenda in an apparently successful portrayal of himself as the guardian of that popular topic.", "democrats countered that the republican-led congress had done nothing all year, and cast the republicans as extremists for blocking the president's plea for more money to hire teachers and modernize schools.", "in fact, republican bargainers said saturday night that they would provide the money if local governments, not washington, could decide how the money would be used.", "armey was one of many who castigated the president for apparent disengagement, an indirect reminder that clinton has been steeped in a sex scandal and is facing an impeachment inquiry in the house.", "the scant number of congressional republicans who did not leave town for the weekend used the house floor to press this same message.", "`what about the president?'", "asked rep. tom delay of texas, the majority whip.", "`maybe in martha's vineyard?", "aspen?", "camp david?", "where is the president?", "i bet the american people don't know that he spent 152 days out of the 283 days this year fund raising, traveling and on vacation.'", "republicans said that clinton had participated in 98 fund-raising events so far this year and that two events on monday in new york, supporting the senate campaign of rep. charles schumer, would bring him to 100. clinton said at the white house that he was `prepared to do whatever it takes' to reach a resolution over the spending bills, and dispatched his aides to capitol hill.", "he also said he would postpone from monday morning until monday afternoon his departure for his fund-raising tour in new york, and he canceled a fund-raising appearance in florida.", "but as the high-level budget bargaining concluded sunday afternoon, both sides agreed they would need to extend their deadline beyond midnight monday, when temporary financing for the government expires for the third time since the oct. 1 start of the fiscal year.", "congressional democrats struck back at the republicans, saying they have held a slack schedule themselves.", "rep. george miller, d-calif., said congress had been in session only 108 days so far this year, an unusually abbreviated period and one consumed for more than a month by the drive to hold impeachment hearings on the president.", "most americans, miller said, had worked more than 225 days.", "`they say, `where is the president?'", "miller said.", "`the president has been waiting for the budget.", "this is the first congress since 1974 that has no budget,' he said, referring to the broad blueprint that is supposed to guide spending.", "`this is a congress that can't pass seven of its appropriations bills,' he said, largely because of divisive splits among conservative and moderate republicans.", "a sticking point for white house and congressional budget negotiators has been the issue of how the 2000 census will be conducted, and the white house is finding itself negotiating on the issue as much with house democrats as it is with the house republican leaders.", "on monday, white house negotiators, led by chief of staff erskine bowles, tried to determine whether democrats would accept a deal to finance for six months the departments of state, justice and commerce, which oversees the census bureau.", "the deal would put off until next march the contentious issue of whether the next census would use statistical sampling to supplement traditional methods of counting people.", "bowles told the group of democrats that the house republicans were willing to give on a number of outstanding issues that were stalling final agreement on the budget, but that they were digging in their heels when it came to financing the census for six months.", "the democrats met in the office of minority leader dick gephardt.", "the rationale for the half-year financing is that by next march the supreme court is expected to rule on whether using sampling is legal or constitutional.", "the supreme court has already agreed to review two lower court rulings that said sampling would violate federal law.", "oral arguments on the cases are set for november.", "but house democrats balked at the idea of six months' financing for the census, arguing that even if the supreme court allowed sampling, the republicans would be under no obligation to approve money for a census that included sampling.", "`the general feeling among many democrats was that even if we won the case, there would be a lot less leverage in march, especially if it was the only issue left to be debated,' said a house democratic official who insisted on anonymity.", "democrats contend that now is the time to press the republicans, while they want to complete work on the budget and go home to campaign.", "rep. lucille roybal-allard, d-calif., who attended the meeting monday, said, `it was, sort of, this is where we are.", "we've been able to accomplish great things, what do you think?", "we made it very clear that unless the census was included, along with some other issues, like school construction, the deal wouldn't be acceptable.'", "statistical sampling would allow the census bureau to estimate populations that are difficult to count, and would have the largest effect on the counting of african-americans in cities and blacks and hispanics in rural areas, groups that are traditionally undercounted by the standard means.", "republicans fear, and democrats hope, that the method would raise the count of people living in traditionally democratic areas, giving the party an advantage when new boundaries for election districts are drawn following the 2000 census.", "at monday's meeting, the democrats reminded administration officials that clinton had promised that he would veto any legislation that restricted the census bureau's ability to conduct an accurate census.", "`i can't think of any way that restricts the census more than not to fully fund it,' said rep. carolyn maloney, d-n.y. the willingness of house democrats, including gephardt, to press the president on the issue represents a realization of their leverage with clinton, who will need all of their support in the coming impeachment inquiry.", "`gephardt is a major player now, and the irony is we helped make him that,' said rep. christopher shays, r-conn., who supports the use of sampling in the census.", "the democrats' position also indicates how little trust many have in the white house on this issue.", "the proposal to finance the departments of commerce, justice and state for six months is similar to one reached last november between bowles and house speaker newt gingrich.", "the idea then was that holding all three departments hostage in the census fight would place maximum pressure on all sides to work out their differences over sampling.", "but house democrats were not consulted before that agreement was struck and later grumbled about it.", "at a meeting of the democratic caucus tuesday, ms. maloney briefed lawmakers on dealings with the white house and declared that clinton had promised that he would hold firm on the census and that she believed him, a participant said.", "the statement was greeted with laughter.", "`there is a certain level of suspicion because there have been times when we have been cut out,'said the house democratic official.", "`but i have to say, there hasn't been much evidence of that, this time.'", "struggling to meet their fourth deadline over the federal budget, congressional republicans and white house officials wrestled tuesday with their differences over education, staging events to demonstrate support for what has become the most public and politically high-stakes element of the budget battle.", "negotiators met into the night to hash out their disagreements over aid for schools, the census and contraceptives.", "these were among the biggest issues that still separated the two sides as each tried to formulate a message to take home to voters for the nov. 3 elections.", "on education, the issue that president clinton has propelled to the forefront of the talks and on which republicans do not want to appear recalcitrant, both sides have agreed to spend more than $1 billion but disagree over how to spend it.", "the president insists the money be spent on hiring 100,000 teachers across the country so that the average class can be reduced to 18 students.", "republicans, railing against `beltway bureaucrats,' say that local school districts should decide how the money is spent, whether it be for teachers or computers.", "the two sides remained apart on several ideological matters, including whether to allow federal health plans to cover contraceptives and whether to allow those few plans with religious affiliations to refuse to cover contraceptives not only on religious grounds but on moral grounds as well.", "and they also were split on how to conduct the census in the year 2000. this is one of the thorniest issues.", "it is not one that moves voters, but it is vital to both parties because it helps determine their relative strength in congress.", "house speaker newt gingrich and erskine bowles, the president's chief

eat into the surplus really will go for emergencies, like relief for victims of hurricane georges.", "but much of the money, like the $90 million that will pay for six new helicopters for the national police in colombia to use in drug interdiction, was designated emergency spending simply because there was no other way to get it into the budget.", "for the politicians, the new way is more fun.",

principal fights this year were not over money at all.", "they involved delicate policy issues like needle exchanges, contraception, global warming, immigration and the census.", "in congress, there is no consensus on these matters.", "so the only way policy could be set was to wrap them into the giant spending bill.", "it may be more pleasant to debate policy than money.", "but it is probably harder to find a way to split the difference.", "as long as the surplus lasts, the lack of discipline that characterized the budget-writing this year is likely to continue.", "this is distressing to

would run better on windows.", "in return, the people say, netscape would give microsoft a seat on its board, license its technology to microsoft, give microsoft advance knowledge of its product-development efforts and not make a browser for the next generation of the microsoft operating system, windows 95, which was shipped two months after the june 1995 meeting.", "and microsoft,

gatekeeper.", "and since microsoft itself makes all manner of software products beyond the operating system, other companies are put in the uneasy position of requiring microsoft's cooperation to be able to compete against it.", "and in the software industry, where every program is rendered in the digital code of 1's and 0's, the lines that divide competition and cooperation are often blurred.", "the talk about that line at the microsoft-netscape meeting focused on the division between the operating system _ the `platform,' in computer terms _ and the application programs, sometimes called `solutions,' that run on top of the operating system.", "the government suit states that in sworn testimony, chris jones, a microsoft manager who attended the meeting, `admitted that microsoft `absolutely' intended to persuade netscape not to compete.'", "microsoft reads jones' testimony very differently, as evidence mainly of the company's clarifying its position.", "if netscape stayed on the applications or solutions side of the operating system, the two companies could be partners, microsoft said.", "but if netscape tried to become a player in the platform space, they would

to suggest that `there would be any consequences to netscape or its business if netscape chose to go in the platform direction you've described earlier as opposed to the solutions direction.'", "jones

technologies.", "that's a done deal.'", "and we're asking them: `what is your business?", "is your business platforms or solutions?", "if it's platforms, we're in the platforms business.", "we're competing.'", "microsoft portrays such comments as innocuous statements of fact.", "but to netscape, the same remarks could be taken as a warning, if not a threat.", "this is because internet browsing software had the potential to become an alternative platform to the windows operating system.", "the browser, sitting on top of the operating system, could supplant windows as the main desktop screen on users' machines and the main layer of programming for starting other software applications.", "in addition, netscape's browser could serve as a powerful platform for distributing and running java, an internet programming language developed by sun microsystems inc., a microsoft rival.", "in technical terms, netscape's upstart platform could replace microsoft's apis as the essential utility of computing.", "indeed, andreessen had boasted in public of netscape's ambition to relegate microsoft's windows to so much software plumbing underneath the browser.", "by the june meeting, microsoft certainly viewed netscape as a serious potential challenger to windows, the corporate crown jewel.", "on may 26, 1995, in an internal memo, `the internet tidal wave,' gates wrote: `a new competitor `born' on the internet is netscape.", "their browser is dominant with 70 percent usage share, allowing them to determine which network extensions will catch on.'", "netscape's strategy, gates wrote,

broadened their allegations against microsoft by adding evidence that it tried to bully intel, apple computer inc. and other companies to squelch competition.", "they say that like the netscape meeting the new evidence fits a pattern of behavior by microsoft, which has repeatedly tried to limit competition by strong-arming competitors and partners.", "one episode that fits the pattern, the prosecutors contend, was an effort by microsoft to pressure intel to shelve the development of multimedia and internet software and to limit its cooperation with netscape.", "intel's main business is making the microprocessor chips that act as the electronic brains of most of the computers that run the windows operating system.", "indeed, the fortunes of intel and microsoft are so closely aligned that the two companies are sometimes referred to as a single, powerful entity, `wintel.'", "but intel also employs hundreds of software engineers, mainly at its intel architecture labs in hillsboro, ore. and while intel and microsoft are partners, they have also had their conflicts, typically over the direction and pace at which certain innovations should be introduced into the personal computer industry, which they dominate together.", "federal and state investigators have focused on microsoft's strong reaction to work being done by intel's software engineers _ a sentiment expressed in no uncertain terms during a meeting at intel's santa clara, calif., headquarters on aug. 2, 1995. the contentious session was attended by several executives from intel and microsoft, including gates and intel chairman andrew grove.", "an internal intel memo stated that gates made `vague threats' about supporting intel's competitors and that he was `livid' about intel's `investments in the internet and wanted them stopped.'", "later, intel did pull back from its multimedia and internet software development.", "steven mcgeady, an intel vice president who attended the august 1995 meeting, is scheduled to appear as a witness for the government.", "microsoft replies that the government's accounts of meetings like those with netscape and intel are fanciful distortions, created by using a biased selection of documents and witnesses.", "the government's case, microsoft asserts, betrays an utter failure to accept the computer-industry reality that microsoft routinely meets with companies to make sure their software and equipment will work well with windows.", "sometimes the talks, microsoft says, go on to include further levels of cooperation like licensing technology or a microsoft investment, as the company discussed with netscape.", "in the trial, microsoft is expected to argue its advance in the browser market was the result of its own business acumen and netscape's missteps.", "to document netscape's errors, microsoft issued a subpoena last month and obtained the unpublished manuscript of a new book, `competing on internet time: lessons from netscape and its battle with microsoft,' which is based on hundreds of interviews with current and former netscape executives.", "the book does chronicle the mistakes made by netscape.", "but its authors, michael cusumano of the massachusetts institute of technology's sloan school of management and david yoffie of the harvard business school, think microsoft is hardly blameless.", "`microsoft's take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, all but inviting retaliation from competitors, the government and even customers,' yoffie said.", "emphasizing that he was offering no legal judgment, yoffie added, `i think microsoft could have achieved 90 percent of what it did without crossing the line as much as it did.'", "the spyglass link: rewards and perils of a partnership on april 6, 1994, gates and 20 microsoft executives gathered for a daylong retreat not far from the company's headquarters in redmond, wash. the subject was the internet and how it might revolutionize the computer software business.", "few concrete plans were made that day, but microsoft executives insist that a direction was set.", "`our vision from the outset was to unite the two worlds of the windows desktop and the internet,' said steven sinofsky, a microsoft executive who attended the meeting.", "yet microsoft badly trailed netscape in the browser field.", "to hasten its entry, microsoft licensed its early browsing software from spyglass inc. of naperville, ill. the first meeting between the two companies was initiated by spyglass in april 1994. at the time, it was a tiny company and eager to do a deal with microsoft.", "spyglass was selected as the commercial licensee for browser technology developed by the national center for supercomputing at the university of illinois.", "in the summer of 1994, douglas colbeth, president of spyglass, met with clark of netscape at o'hare international airport in chicago.", "the two men talked in the united airlines red carpet room, reserved for business-class passengers, and colbeth recalled clark telling him, `we're going to take microsoft head-on.'", "at the time, colbeth recalled thinking to himself, `great, now microsoft will really want to license from me.'", "today, he noted: `remember, we were a company with a couple dozen people and almost no money in the bank.", "netscape had jim clark, with his money and reputation, and big-time venture capital backing from silicon valley.", "netscape had a very different agenda.'", "by july 1994, microsoft had become quite interested in the spyglass technology, colbeth says, and the two companies signed their first licensing agreement the following december.", "microsoft, colbeth recalls, always told him that it would eventually fold browser technology into its operating system, but its timing was accelerated by netscape's rapid rise.", "`microsoft was initially hoping to charge for the browser,' colbeth said.", "but on dec. 7, 1995, gates declared that microsoft would not only deeply integrate its browser into windows but would give it away.", "the announcement caught the industry, even colbeth, by surprise.", "at the time, spyglass had licensed its technology to 82 other companies, including ibm and digital equipment, for use in their software products _ a licensing revenue stream of about $20 million a year.", "as a result of microsoft's move, spyglass saw those revenues vanish within a year, as smaller internet software companies went out of business and big customers shifted to microsoft's free browser.", "spyglass slashed its payroll and scrambled into new niches of the software industry to replace its lost sales, which it succeeded in doing eventually.", "`whenever you license technology to microsoft, you have to understand it can someday build it itself, drop it into the operating system and put you out of that business,' colbeth said.", "the nonoption compaq: suddenly sees the light well into 1996, netscape's share of the browser market continued to rise, while microsoft made little headway, even though its browser was free.", "industry analysts and trade magazines agreed that netscape's browser was the clear technical leader.", "in april 1996, netscape's navigator was used by 87 percent of people browsing the web, compared with 4 percent using microsoft's internet explorer, according to zona research.", "so the biggest personal computer maker, compaq, thought it made sense to give customers netscape's browser instead of microsoft's.", "but microsoft would not stand for that _ and compaq had no choice but to give in.", "in june 1996, compaq wanted not only to load the more popular netscape browser on its machines but also to remove the icon for microsoft's internet explorer, which was delivered to the computer maker with windows 95. microsoft informed compaq that if it removed internet explorer, the computer maker would lose its license for windows, said stephen decker, compaq's director of software procurement, in testimony to federal investigators.", "the ultimatum from microsoft was delivered bluntly in a letter headed, `notice of intent to terminate license agreement.'", "faced with being denied the essential operating system, compaq quickly reversed course and kept the internet explorer icon.", "microsoft asserts that windows and internet explorer are a single product and that microsoft alone defines what is in the product.", "nothing in its contracts, microsoft adds, prohibits computer makers from including competing technologies.", "while the cutoff letter microsoft sent to compaq seems an unnecessarily hardball tactic when dealing with its largest corporate customer, microsoft chief operating officer bob herbold insists that `to take one letter here or one snippet of e-mail there to try to portray microsoft as an arrogant company is unfair.'", "noting that a compaq executive is a witness for microsoft, herbold said, `we are totally dependent on tremendous relationships with key companies like compaq.'", "at netscape, however, the compaq episode was a watershed.", "`that was the singular act that got me going to the justice department,' barksdale recalled.", "barksdale said he regarded microsoft's tactic of forcing compaq to buy its browser as a condition of obtaining an essential product, the windows operating system, as `an illegal act and absolute proof that microsoft was a monopolist.'", "after investigating the incident, the justice department and the states agreed with barksdale that microsoft was illegally tying the sale of one product to another.", "microsoft replies that it has a long history of adding new features to its operating system.", "and from the outset, microsoft says, it intended that windows and its internet explorer browser would be seamlessly integrated, as they are now in windows 98. thus, microsoft insists, there is no product-tying violation of antitrust laws.", "in a separate case, a federal appeals court sided with microsoft, upholding the principle that the company could put whatever it wanted to in its operating system and declare it a single product.", "but in june 1996, when compaq wanted to offer the netscape product instead of microsoft's browser, most industry experts viewed the browser and operating system as two different software programs.", "`it took a long time for the integration strategy to play out,' said a former senior microsoft researcher.", "`back then, integration was basically bolting a browser onto windows.'", "the `balancing act': america online tosses in towel america online chairman stephen case refers to dealing with microsoft as `a delicate balancing act.'", "that balance swung sharply from the fall of 1995 to the spring of 1996, when microsoft used the lure of giving america online a featured place on the windows desktop as the ultimate bargaining chip.", "to gain access to computing's most coveted real estate, america online agreed to make microsoft's internet explorer the main browser for its online subscribers, who now number more than 13 million.", "yet throughout 1995, as microsoft prepared to introduce windows 95, the most significant improvement ever in its operating system, case was knocking on the door of the justice department.", "his complaint was that microsoft was going to place its new online service, microsoft network, a direct competitor to america online, prominently on the desktop screen of windows 95, which was introduced in august.", "this bundling tactic of using the industry-dominant operating system to market microsoft network, or msn, case argued, gave microsoft an unfair advantage in the young but fast-growing online business.", "the justice department listened and investigated.", "but ultimately, the government decided against taking any action.", "at america online's headquarters in vienna, va., microsoft was both feared and loathed at the time.", "america online had a designated `microsoft watcher,' a young m.b.a. who tracked its adversary's every move.", "above the desk in his small, windowless office was a picture of gates.", "beneath the picture, in large block letters, were the words `the enemy.'", "though america online was the clear leader in the online services business, it had ample reason to worry about an all-out assault by a rival as rich and aggressive as microsoft.", "when he had visited the microsoft headquarters a couple of years earlier, case recalled, gates had bluntly assessed microsoft's options by saying he could buy 20 percent of america online, all of it or enter the online business on his own and `bury you.'", "a threat or merely a statement of the facts?", "`a bit of both,' case said recently.", "`but he was mainly articulating what everybody at that meeting kind of intuitively understood.'", "yet by 1996, microsoft and america online found they had reason to cooperate.", "with the exploding popularity of the internet's world wide web, the conventional online companies, like america online and compuserve, had to provide their customers internet access as well as their own services.", "america online had its own browser, but to keep pace with the rapidly advancing technology it made sense to do a deal with netscape or microsoft.", "for both software companies, a deal with america online, which had 5 million subscribers at the time, could mean a big surge in browser use and market share.", "netscape seemed the natural partner for america online, since both companies were microsoft rivals.", "on march 11, america online did announce that it would buy netscape technology, but it was a standard licensing deal based on a payment-for-use formula.", "the next day, america online announced a more significant deal with microsoft making its browser the default technology _ the browser america online subscribers would use unless they specifically asked for netscape's navigator.", "to win the deal, microsoft offered to give america online a start-up icon on the windows desktop _ precisely the kind of equal treatment on the main windows screen that case had asked the justice department to require of microsoft.", "`after we agreed to its internet explorer browser, microsoft allowed us to be bundled on the windows desktop,' case said.", "`it was an example of microsoft's pragmatic side.'", "the pragmatic decision was that the paramount corporate goal was to increase browser market share to protect the mainstay software business.", "as a result, its new online service, msn, would have to sacrifice an important marketing advantage over its main rival, america online.", "`it was bill's decision,' said former msn general manager russell siegelman, referring to gates.", "`he sent me e-mail on it.", "he said he didn't think it would hurt msn that much.", "i disagreed with him.'", "to other microsoft executives, gates expressed a different view of the likely impact on msn.", "he told senior vice president brad silverberg that putting america online on the windows desktop would amount to `putting a bullet through msn's head,' according to a deposition taken by the justice department.", "in the antitrust suit, the government asserts that the america online deal shows how microsoft used the power of its windows monopoly to give it an edge in the browser war against netscape.", "david colburn, a senior vice president of america online who took part in the browser negotiations with microsoft, is a witness for the government.", "today, microsoft has overhauled its internet strategy to focus mainly on

think it won't in this business as well.", "we will always be in microsoft's cross hairs.'", "the lesson: don't confront a steamroller at netscape's headquarters in silicon valley, the strategy today

"silicon valley's venture capitalists, the investors who finance so many of the nation's high-tech startups, generally follow the netscape formula these days.", "yet that still leaves ample room to prosper.", "for while competing directly with microsoft is dangerous, the software industry as a whole is an engine of wealth creation, job generation and technical innovation.", "and there is an ambivalent side to the venture community's relationship with microsoft.", "for if a start-up cannot steer clear of microsoft entirely, the favored option is to be bought out by microsoft, which has scooped up many fledgling companies as a way of acquiring promising technology and people.", "`microsoft understands start-up innovation and how to co-opt start-up innovation better than any other high-tech company,' said james breyer, managing partner of accel partners, a venture capital firm.", "as microsoft has grown, it has come to be seen not merely as a competitor but as a force of nature that shapes the business environment, like a weather front.", "`microsoft is incredibly pervasive,' said stewart alsop, a partner with new enterprise associates, a venture capital firm in menlo park, calif. at the board meetings of the companies in which his firm has invested, two issues always come up, he said: `one is the price of the company's stock, and the other is what microsoft is going to do.'", "in the last few years, microsoft has offered its guidance during almost yearly meetings between senior microsoft executives and leading venture capitalists.", "the meetings are part of microsoft's effort to improve its sometimes prickly relations with silicon valley.", "`we work hard to provide clarity about where we're going and where we're not going,' said greg maffei, microsoft's chief financial officer.", "last year's conference took place in october at the quadrus office building on sand hill road in menlo park, the wall street of high-tech venture investing.", "maffei led a team of five microsoft executives who appeared before a group of 40 venture capitalists, one of whom stood and asked the question that seemed to be on the minds of many of his peers: `how do i invest in a company that stays out of the way of the steamroller?'", "maffei, recalled one person who attended the meeting, stood up and delivered a brief lecture on businesses that microsoft was likely to avoid.", "his list included specialized software for manufacturing, human resources management, computer-aided design and others.", "but, this person noted, broad swaths of the industry appeared to be designated as off limits _ including new software platforms that might compete with microsoft's personal computer operating system.", "at one point, ruthann quindlen, a partner with institutional venture partners, leaned over to vinod khosla, a co-founder of sun microsystems and a partner at the venture capital firm kleiner perkins caufield &amp; byers, and said quietly, `i guess that leaves us washing machines and toasters.'", "a federal judge friday pushed back the starting date of the antitrust trial against microsoft corp. by four days, to oct. 19, while also ordering the company to comply with the justice department's request to examine microsoft's financial records.", "microsoft argued that allowing `an army of government attorneys to come in and make demands will make it very difficult for us to remain in business.'", "but after winning assurances from government lawyers that they would make only narrow, targeted searches of the records, judge thomas penfield jackson of the u.s. district court for the district of columbia ordered microsoft to open the database for perusal.", "microsoft had asked that the trial be delayed several more months to prepare a defense against what it said was a last minute broadening of the case by the justice department, which had added new evidence.", "last month, the government said that in the process of preparing for the trial it had discovered that microsoft tried to persuade apple computer not to market its quicktime multimedia software to windows customers.", "on thursday, the justice department and 20 states added two new people to their witness list to testify about microsoft dealings with apple and with sun microsystems.", "avi tevanian, a former apple executive, was added to the witness list in part to describe microsoft's proposal, which microsoft denies ever having made.", "the other new witness was james gosling, a sun executive who led the development of java, an internet programming language that microsoft sees as a potential threat to the company's dominance of the software market.", "the government is charging that microsoft took illegal steps to prevent java from gaining wide acceptance.", "to counter that, microsoft named two new witnesses friday, robert muglia, a senior microsoft executive who has worked with sun, and chris engstrom, an executive who handled some of microsoft's dealings with apple.", "at the same time, john warden, microsoft's lawyer, argued that the new allegations had no place in the case.", "the justice department, warden told the judge, was `trying to turn this into something approximating a plenary monopoly case like the ibm case.'", "`it becomes clearer and clearer and clearer with each new filing that they are trying to turn this into a broader case,' he said.", "`you can't have this bait-and-switch in which they file a complaint alleging a, b, c, and then talk about the whole alphabet three times over.'", "as a result, warden said, microsoft wanted, at a minimum, another two-week delay, even though `a more normal schedule' would have the trial start next year.", "the judge did not respond.", "instead he entered an order setting the oct. 19 trial date.", "late friday, microsoft entered a formal motion asking for another two-week delay.", "a response is expected next week.", "microsoft corp. has said that material in an unpublished book by two business school professors will be a crucial part of its defense in the antitrust trial scheduled to begin next week.", "but judging from an advance copy of the manuscript, the justice department and 20 states that are suing the software giant will find support for their arguments in the book as well.", "to cite one example, microsoft contends that its industry-standard windows operating system and its internet explorer browser are a single integrated product.", "in its suit, the government asserts that they are two separate products that microsoft bundled together to get an unfair edge over its rival, netscape communications corp., in the market for software used to browse the internet's world wide web.", "in `competing on internet time: lessons from netscape and its battle with microsoft,' the authors, michael a. cusumano of the massachusetts institute of technology's sloan school of management and david b. yoffie of the harvard business school, quote a microsoft executive as saying that only with the third version of microsoft's browser was it integrated with windows.", "microsoft hurried its first browser offerings into the market, the book says, in its race to catch up with netscape, then took a more ambitious approach with internet explorer 3.0, which was introduced in august 1996. in that version it changed its software design to use programming modules, or components, that could be put together and rearragned like building blocks.", "in the book, ben slivka, a microsoft general manager, is quoted as saying, `ie 3.0 was the key thing because we did the componentized browser,' he added, `we really made internet explorer part of the windows platform.'", "the timing could be legally significant because in its suit the government cites as evidence requests before august 1996 by personal computer makers that wanted to load netscape's browser on their machines instead of microsoft's browser.", "microsoft denied the requests, insisting its browers and windows were a single, integrated product.", "microsoft's legal team obtained an early manuscript of the new book last month, by issuing a subpoena to a netscape executive who was given a confidential copy by the authors to review.", "microsoft has also sought the transcripts of 44 current and former netscape employees interviewed by the authors.", "a federal judge in boston last week denied microsoft access to that research materials, but the company may appeal the ruling.", "the new book, published by the free press imprint of simon &amp; schuster, is being hurried into print so it can be shipped within days of the start of the microsoft trial on oct. 19. but already, a few quotes from netscape executives have leaked out.", "the authors decided to send the complete manuscript to the new york times and three other news organizations monday, so that the material could be read in context.", "microsoft intends to use material from the book as evidence that netscape's troubles resulted largely from its own missteps rather than from any alleged predatory practices by microsoft.", "the book does detail where netscape stumbled, shifting its strategy too often and running into obstacles in its software development efforts.", "in private antitrust suits, the argument that the competitor was his own worst enemy is an established defense.", "but legal experts say that defense may well be far less effective in a federal case in which the government is seeking court-mandated changes in microsoft's business practices rather than the monetary damages that are the goal of plaintiffs in private cases.", "`it seems to me that this debate over netscape's mistakes is a total sideshow,' said robert litan, a former senior official in the justice department's antitrust division, who is now at the brookings institution.", "`but microsoft has a big legal team, and it seems they are working on every defense they can find.'", "the book quotes a former netscape executive, ram shriram, as saying the company bungled a chance to win a sizable share of the browser business from america online inc. but that was a second-chance to do a deal with america online, the leading online service.", "the government's case focuses on an earlier deal in march 1996, when america online chose internet explorer as its preferred browser; in that bargain microsoft agreed to place a startup icon for the online service on the main windows desktop screen _ the prime real estate in computing.", "for a book entitled `competing on internet time,' it is intriguing that one of its central themes is that netcape got too wedded to the notion that the internet revolution would change everything quickly.", "microsoft, by contrast, stuck to its three-year planning horizon that enabled the company, the authors write, to `mesh its short-run tactical plans with a broader strategic view of how to win the war.'", "the book quotes steve ballmer, microsoft's president, as saying, `the fact of the matter is that customers can't take cataclysmic change every three months.", "the organization also can't.", "you can ship products quickly.", "but you can't say, `oh, we have a radically new strategy' every three months.'", "the case of united states vs. microsoft corp., the government's most aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years, is playing out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court rulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same rulings to support their opposing arguments.", "whatever the outcome of the trial, scheduled to begin monday in u.s. district court in washington, an almost certain appeal will leave to the supreme court the task of bringing legal order to 100 years of clashing antitrust doctrines.", "the case focuses on microsoft's windows, the operating system that controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today.", "the government says its objective

attorney general who headed the antitrust division during the bush administration, and he is now a washington lawyer who serves as an adviser and advocate for microsoft.", "`when i was there,' rule said of his justice days, `the white house was punctilious in terms of never getting involved in whatever we decided to do.", "there was no communication between antitrust and other branches of government.'", "asked if he believed that policy had changed under the clinton administration, he said: `not really.", "i've seen nothing to suggest it.'", "joel klein heads the antitrust division now, and in an interview dealing with his division's role in the clinton administration's technology policy, not specifically relating to the microsoft case, he said: `there is no statutory restriction, but as a practical matter, civil and criminal prosecutions are invariably carried out without any political contact.'", "klein said, by way of examples, that he might discuss merger cases involving military or aviation industries with the defense department or transportation department.", "`but never the white house,' he said.", "`for a significant case, we might call the white house and say `an hour from now we are going to hold a press conference.'", "' `the last time there was any interference,' he added, `was the dita beard-itt case.'", "mrs. beard, a lobbyist for itt corp., was accused in 1972 of having written a memo saying that a $400,000 donation to the republican national convention had `gone a long way' toward settling antitrust suits brought against the company by the nixon administration's justice department.", "the authenticity of the memo was never proved, and mrs. beard always denied writing it.", "in any case, klein says, `since watergate, it's been immaculate.'", "in the case of microsoft, neither president clinton nor vice president al gore has ever volunteered a comment.", "in answer to a question during a news conference in may, just before the suit was filed, clinton said: `i have taken the view that i should not comment on matters within the justice department.", "at this time, i do not think i should depart from that policy on this case, even though it obviously will have a big impact on an important sector of our economy.", "but i have to say, based on what i know to date, i have confidence in the way the antitrust division in the justice department has handled the matter.'", "since then, clinton has said nothing else about the case, publicly at least.", "and gore, who generally represents the administration on technology issues, has never commented at all.", "in rule's opinion, the administration would be foolish to involve itself, even if it were politically acceptable to do so.", "`it would be a little odd for the administration to push the justice department in this suit,' he said.", "`it would be a policy mistake and a political mistake.", "i would be hard pressed to explain why they would do that.'", "taking sides in the highly charged technology world is dangerous, particularly since the democrats rely on silicon valley companies for political donations and support.", "in fact, the present and former government officials all said the suit was simply a natural extension of the inquiries conducted during the last nine years.", "they began at the ftc.", "soon after washington read that article in byte, the ftc staff opened an investigation of the windows-os/2 question.", "but as has happened so often in the following years, turns in the market made the initial inquiry irrelevant.", "microsoft abandoned its agreement with ibm, and windows quickly grew to be the industry standard, while os/2 remained a cipher.", "but as that issue faded, once government investigators began looking at microsoft they found other things that troubled them.", "in 1991 washington, who still works for the ftc, informed microsoft that the investigation was being expanded.", "the agency, his letter said, was now trying to determine whether microsoft was using its dominant position in operating-systems software to stifle competition in other areas.", "that general idea lies at the heart of the present suit.", "one former senior ftc official said the commission staff had confidence in the case but realized that the reagan-era commissioners, who had to approve any suit, might have a different view.", "`we knew the commission might have difficulty with a monopolization case,' the former official said.", "`they hadn't brought a case in years.'", "and in fact, in 1993 the commission voted 2-2 on the question of whether to file formal charges.", "the deadlock served as a dismissal.", "then, a few months later, the justice department decided to pick up the case.", "`it was farther along than most cases we got,' recalled robert litan, a former senior official in the justice department's antitrust division who is now at the brookings institution.", "`usually a case would be two or three people complaining and a few documents,' he said.", "`but this was a fully researched record.", "they gave us the files and briefed us on what they had done.'", "the justice department lawyers picked up the same thread.", "`the general idea behind our inquiry,' litan said, `was that they should not be allowed to use their monopoly in operating systems to cement a monopoly in other areas.'", "in 1995, microsoft and the government reached a consent agreement in which the company promised to stop forcing pc makers to buy one copy of a microsoft operating system for every computer sold _ instead of one for every computer on which the operating system, ms-dos or windows, was installed.", "the company also agreed to stop tying the sale of one software product to the sale of another.", "the charges in the present suit are similar in many ways.", "even with the agreement, the government investigations continued.", "that same year, justice department investigators showed up at the offices of netscape communications corp. for the first time to ask questions about their next line of inquiry.", "`america online had been complaining,' a senior netscape executive recalled, `because microsoft was bundling the microsoft network,' a competing online service, `with windows.'", "once more, market forces overtook the investigation.", "the microsoft network never grew particularly popular while america online prospered and grew.", "but, not surprisingly, new complaints filled the void.", "in may 1995, anne bingaman, the assistant attorney general who headed the antitrust division, remarked: `we get complaints about microsoft all the time.", "we have become a kind of microsoft complaints center.", "and we take them very seriously.'", "in 1996, netscape's first complaint arrived.", "in a letter to the justice department, netscape said that microsoft was using its dominance in personal-computer operating systems to force or persuade computer makers to favor microsoft's browser, used to explore the world wide web, over the one marketed by netscape.", "the next year the justice department formally charged microsoft with violating the consent agreement by tying sales of windows to installation of the company's web browser on new computers.", "`it seemed like a slam-dunk violation of the consent decree,' a natural extension of that case, recalled litan, who had left the department by then.", "a federal district court judge agreed, but an appeals court panel overturned that ruling this summer.", "in the meantime, last may the justice department and 20 state attorneys general filed their new suit against microsoft, which is scheduled for trial on monday.", "it contends that microsoft has engaged in bundling, tying and other predatory behavior similar in many ways to the numerous previous allegations and investigations of the last nine years.", "`a good part of this case is just round ii of the case we dealt with in round i,' in the early in the 1990s, litan said.", "or, as the former senior ftc official put it, `there's certainly a common thread that runs all the way through here.'", "but through the years that thread has been twisted, pulled and spun by hundreds of different hands.", "shortly before the government filed its antitrust suit against microsoft corp. in may, joel klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the justice department's antitrust division, met with a silicon valley executive.", "the executive recalls telling klein that unless a case went beyond the internet browser market, it would have little effect on microsoft's power to stifle competition across the computer industry.", "klein replied that he understood the computer executive's concerns.", "but he said time was running short and the strongest evidence in hand involved microsoft's battle against netscape communications corp. in the market for the so-called browser software used for navigating the internet.", "`this is a netscape case,' the executive recalls klein saying.", "but five months later, the case that the government is bringing to trial on monday extends well beyond netscape and the browser war to embrace what it described in a recent court filing as `a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct' by microsoft.", "netscape, the government insists, is still a prime example of the pattern _ but only one of several examples.", "the 12-person witness list for the justice department and 20 states suing microsoft reflects the new evidence added to the case since may.", "james barksdale, netscape's president and chief executive, will appear first, but he will be followed by executives representing a cross section of the nation's high-technology companies including intel, ibm, sun microsystems, apple computer, america online and intuit.", "in bringing a more ambitious, complicated case to trial than the one it filed in may, the government has chosen a high-risk strategy.", "the law states that new evidence can be added to a suit after it is filed, but not new charges.", "and so, in his federal courtroom in washington, u.s.district judge thomas penfield jackson could decide to rule out some of the new evidence as ranging too far afield from the original suit.", "but if the government wins its broadened case, the court-ordered remedies would no doubt be far tougher on microsoft.", "in may, the government's suggested steps amounted to equal treatment for netscape's browser and microsoft's browser.", "but the government recently asked that the judge hold a separate hearing on remedies, if it wins the case.", "the remedies under consideration now include more basic changes in microsoft's business practices _ perhaps even a breakup of the company _ intended to loosen microsoft's grip on computing.", "that would be precisely the kind of sweeping reform that microsoft's foes would applaud.", "`the government has doubled the bet and doubled the stakes,' said david yoffie, a professor at the harvard business school who is co-author of the book, `competing on internet time: lessons from netscape and its battle with microsoft.'", "meanwhile, in the microsoft camp, the government's strategy is dismissed as a desperate act _ taken after a court ruling in june that threatened to undermine the antitrust suit.", "that ruling came in a separate case, involving the interpretation of the consent decree that microsoft signed with the justice department in 1995. in the june ruling, a federal appeals court said that microsoft could bundle its browser with its industry-standard windows operating system and call them one product.", "the appeals-court ruling would seem to undercut the assertion in the government's current antitrust case that the browser and the operating system were two separate products, bundled together and given away in an effort to thwart competition in the browser market.", "`with the appeals-court ruling in june, the government lost the heart of its case,' said charles rule, a former senior official in the justice department, who is now a consultant to microsoft.", "`so it has taken a blunderbuss approach of scrambling to throw everything it can find _ even evidence the justice department has had for years _ into the gun barrel and see what hits.'", "the june appellate ruling did shake the prosecution team.", "but mostly it strengthened the hand of those within the justice department who had been urging that the case be broadened, according to people who have worked on the investigation.", "at the same time, they say, new evidence was coming in as the investigation moved ahead and prosecutors raced to meet the accelerated trial schedule approved by the court.", "speed was a priority from the outset, they say.", "the justice department and the states filed their suit in may to move before microsoft's new operating system, windows 98, was introduced in june.", "while not seeking to block the release of windows 98, government lawyers wanted to get to the the courtroom as early as possible as pc makers and computer users adopt this latest version of microsoft's windows operating system, which functions as the central nervous system for more than 90 percent of personal computers sold.", "the key allegations, government lawyers note, have not changed since may _ namely, that microsoft illegally used its market power in operating systems to defend its monopoly position and to try to extend into new markets.", "`but the only thing that was wrapped up in a bow in time for the may filing was the browser,' said one person who worked on the case.", "`the real game plan was always to get a broader case.'", "what is more, one person noted, the prosecution team was not at full strength until shortly before the suit was filed.", "david boies, a renowned courtroom litigator and a former partner at cravath, swaine &amp; moore who successfully defended ibm in its 13-year confrontation with the government, was named as special counsel for the justice department last december.", "but boies, who left cravath last year, did not start working full-time for the justice department until mid-april, because he was still finishing private cases for his own firm, boies &amp; schiller.", "the antitrust suit filed in may leaned heavily on the netscape story, mentioning microsoft's main rival in the browser market some 130 times in the complaint and a supporting memorandum.", "but it also prominently mentioned microsoft's tactics against sun microsystems, creator of java, an internet programming language, and cited it as an `example' of microsoft's behavior.", "`it was crafted as a template that could be added to without much stretching,' one person involved in the case said.", "and so, as new evidence piled up and seemed to fit into a pattern, klein step by step approved the widening of the case, the person said.", "and that explains, the person continued, how it is that evidence that has been in the hands of the justice department for years has been added to the case since may; only after gathering new evidence did it become apparent that the older material fit the pattern of the current case.", "for example, the government has added the contention that microsoft pressured intel corp., the big microchip maker and a close partner of microsoft, to curb its development efforts in multimedia and internet software because they might conflict with microsoft's plans.", "the government contends that the arm-twisting occurred at meetings between the two companies three years ago, especially one on aug. 2, 1995, which was attended by andrew grove, the intel chairman, and bill gates, the microsoft chairman.", "part of the government's evidence in the intel-microsoft episode is copies of the handwritten notes taken by steven mcgeady, an intel vice president who attended the meetings, and a memo written by him on aug. 28, 1995. the memo, still under court seal, said that gates `made vague threats' and was `livid' about intel's investments in the internet `and wanted them stopped.'", "a handwritten note, also under court seal, quotes paul maritz, a microsoft executive, as saying that netscape is their `common enemy' and that intel's role should be to `fill in stuff in and around microsoft's strategy.'", "these documents were sent by intel to the justice department's office in san francisco in november 1995, in response to a civil investigative demand _ a civil subpoena _ served on intel on nov. 10, 1995. on its own, the intel material was intriguing, but it became part of the antitrust suit only as other evidence surfaced, one person close to the case said.", "the government is contending that microsoft also tried to urge apple to stop selling its quicktime multimedia software in the windows market and tried to convince real networks inc. to pull back in the market for so-called streaming software.", "the government case has also broadened, people involved in the case say, as more witnesses from the industry have been increasingly willing to testify.", "`in the beginning, most people in the industry believed that the government would lose and microsoft would retaliate if they came forward,' one person said.", "`but as the strength of our case was perceived to improve, more people were willing to come forward, and things snowballed.", "you get intel, it's easier to get apple and so on.'", "following is the text of the first two sections of the sherman act, as passed by congress in 1890. as the foundation on which federal antitrust law has been built, the act has been amended several times _ elevating the crime to a felony, increasing the fines and prison terms for individuals and setting fines for corporations convicted of violating it.", "in the case of microsoft, the government has invoked the sherman act to file a civil suit that seeks to change the company's business practices, not a criminal suit that seeks financial penalties.", "an act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies: section 1. every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal.", "every person who shall make any such contract or engage in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.", "section 2. every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade of commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.", "will it matter to consumers that bill gates isn't a nice guy?", "until last week, most americans thought of gates, the chairman of the microsoft corp., as a genius and innovator.", "a nerd perhaps _ but also a self-styled visionary who almost single-handedly unlocked the power of the personal computer.", "monday, however, in a washington courtroom, the justice department began painting a different, darker portrait of gates.", "in an antitrust suit brought by the department and 20 states, the man whose company commands a 97 percent share of the market for personal computer operating systems is being depicted as a nixonian schemer who will go to almost any length to crush his competition.", "product innovation, the suit argues, is not a sufficient weapon for gates.", "flashing back and forth between snippets of gates' videotaped deposition and e-mail messages he had sent that contradicted his testimony, the government sought to establish a pattern of threats and offers of payments by the microsoft chairman.", "it also sought to cast gates as an obsessed man who feared the tiny netscape communications corp. and its potential threat to his domination of the market for internet browsers, the software used to navigate the world wide web.", "gates was portrayed by justice department litigator david boies as a schoolyard bully who rides roughshod over the computer industry with a crudeness that is in stark contrast to his popular image as a benevolent dictator and high-technology guru.", "according to a document presented by boies, for example, gates asked america online executives in 1996: `how much do we need to pay you' to damage netscape?", "`this is your lucky day.'", "the implication, boies said, was that the amount was irrelevant, and that microsoft, with its deep pockets and market dominance, makes as many `offers you can't refuse' as needed to achieve its goals.", "microsoft officials are closely watching market surveys for any hint that the new image of a bare-knuckled gates might be detracting from the company's world-famous brand name, but they insist that the public will continue to draw a distinction between allegations of anticompetitive business tactics and the company's software.", "`despite what you're reading in the press, people judge us by our products,' said mich matthews, head of microsoft's corporate public-relations office.", "`our experience is that people vote with their pocketbooks.'", "so far, consumers are casting positive votes.", "last week microsoft reported quarterly profits of $1.52 billion, a stunning 58 percent increase over the level a year earlier.", "despite the record profits, some marketing experts say that if the public comes to view gates as a rockefeller-style robber baron, his company and its brand name may suffer.", "`when you have a company with such a visible chief executive, the ceo is really the driver of the brand,' said david aaker, a brand marketing expert at the haas school of business at the university of california at berkeley.", "`there is no question this is going to affect microsoft's brand recognition.'", "already there are early warning signals, as political cartoons in newspapers across the country bashed gates last week.", "one showed him holding a globe and saying, `if you don't play my way, i'll take my ball and go home'; another portrayed the microsoft chairman standing next to a henchman dangling someone from a window while a microsoft secretary says to a caller, `i'm sorry, but mr. gates is busy teaching a competitor about windows.'", "but some industry analysts believe the new view of a bill gates who knows how to play hardball may not be such a bad thing for his company.", "the he-said, she-said round of e-mail messages being dragged out in court cases both in washington and in silicon valley, where microsoft is locked in a legal battle with its archrival, sun microsystems inc., is viewed by some as little different from the exaggerated trash talking that goes on in professional sports.", "`it's like taking what charles barkley and michael jordan say to each other on the ball court' and turning it into something more sinister than it really is, said paul andrews, co-author with stephen manes of `gates' (doubleday, 1993).", "indeed, there is evidence that the darker view of gates and his company has so far taken root only in the district of columbia and in silicon valley, where the computer industry has long felt the impact of gates' tactics, and where bitterness and distrust of microsoft are deep.", "in the rest of the country, gates continues to enjoy great popularity.", "two weeks ago, while speaking before a crowd of almost 7,000 students at indiana university, a questioner who asked about the justice department's suit was roundly booed.", "bill gates, whipping boy c.1998 n.y. times news

the country last week.", "from chattanooga to boston, cartoonists took delight in demonizing gates, who is facing an unexpected public relations challenge as microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds in washington.", "other cartoons ran the gamut from the predictable (a worker, pointing to an aquarium in which a large fish is gobbling up smaller ones, saying to some visitors, `welcome to microsoft's research and development department') to the weird (a dweebish man hunched in front of a computer screen staring at the words: `our beloved leader, mr. gates, is under attack.", "leave your

arrests.", "zha got interested in politics as a radical youth, following mao tse-tung's appeals to go to the countryside in 1968. when he returned to beijing in 1989, he marched in the tiananmen protests and continued his activism.", "friends introduced him to xu wenli in 1995. having been released from prison two years before, xu was still not openly involved in dissident politics, but he held court in his beijing home to discuss china's future.", "by sentencing two of the country's most prominent democracy campaigners to long prison terms, china on monday took its harshest steps yet in its current crackdown on organized political opposition.", "after a trial that lasted just three and a half hours, xu wenli _ at 55 the dean of the dissident movement, and a man who has already spent 12 years in prison for advocating democracy _ was sentenced to 13 years for `subversion of state power.'", "xu's alleged crimes included helping to organize a new political party, calling for an end to communist rule in interviews with foreign journalists, calling for independent labor unions and, prosecutors said, accepting $500 from a dissident abroad.", "he was defended by a lawyer who was appointed by the court just four days ago and met his client only once.", "also sentenced monday, to 11 years in prison, was wang youcai, 32, founder of the china democracy party, which has now been suppressed.", "wang was tried on subversion charges on thursday in a brief court session, with no defense lawyer, in the eastern city of hangzhou.", "the punishment of a third veteran democracy campaigner, qin yongmin, 44, has not been announced.", "his trial began in the central city of wuhan on thursday and may reconvene on tuesday, relatives said.", "a similarly long sentence is expected.", "monday's sentences, which came just six months after president clinton's visit to beijing, where he publicly challenged china's leaders to move quickly toward political reform, were harshly criticized by the state department.", "they also appeared to spell the effective end here of the china democracy party, which these three men, along with hundreds of lesser-known individuals, tried to organize in recent months.", "the long sentences also crushed the hopes of many liberal intellectuals here that china's warming relations with the united states in recent years and its signing of global treaties on human rights might bring a significant easing of political controls.", "xu was tried monday morning in the beijing intermediate court.", "when after a brief recess the three-judge panel announced his 13-year sentence, xu stood up and shouted, `i protest!'", "said his wife of 28 years, he xintong.", "then, said ms. he and lawyers who were present, he shouted that the judges were unfair and that he would not appeal his case because the proceedings were illegitimate.", "with the sentencing of xu, china's communist government has silenced one of its most energetic and persistent critics, one who has given over his adult life to the cause of democracy.", "xu first came to prominence during the democracy wall movement of the late 1970s, then served 12 years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement.", "in the last several months, sensing a new opportunity to speak out and making constant use of fax machines and e-mail, he and qin tried to draw attention to china's obligations under two international covenants it has signed _ one on economic and cultural rights, and one on civil and political rights.", "in the face of several temporary detentions and stiff warnings, they continued their activities.", "wang, in contrast, first became involved in dissident activities in 1989, while a graduate student in physics in beijing, when he became a leader of the tiananmen square demonstrations.", "after the student movement was smashed by the army, he was on the most-wanted list, then was arrested and spent two years in prison.", "during clinton's visit to china in june, wang announced the formation of the china democracy party.", "hundreds around the country, including xu and qin, began promoting the idea.", "but while the government has allowed somewhat freer discussion of political topics in universities and obscure journals in the last year, it has not allowed any challenges _ in print or in the form of organized groups _ to the principle of communist party rule.", "in a speech on friday celebrating 20 years of economic reforms, the president and communist party chief, jiang zemin, emphasized the primacy of the party, saying, `the western mode of political systems must never be adopted.'", "after learning of monday's sentences, the american embassy here, which has spent the last two years building improved relations between china and the united states, issued a strong condemnation of what it termed the `deplorable decisions.'", "`we are deeply disappointed with both the guilty verdicts and the extremely harsh sentences,' the statement said.", "`no individual should be arrested, tried and sentenced for exercising internationally recognized freedoms, including those guaranteed in the international covenant on civil and political rights, to which china has committed itself.'", "like thursday's trials, both of which proceeded with no defense attorneys because prospective lawyers had been warned off by police or detained, monday's proceeding showed that in cases involving security issues, police and courts could write their own rules.", "according to the criminal procedure law, defendants are to be notified at least 10 days before a trial, but xu was told only four days ago that his trial would be monday.", "his wife, who until monday had not been allowed to contact him since his arrest on nov. 30, was told three days ago.", "under the law, defendants also have the right to a lawyer of their choice, but xu was assigned a lawyer by the court late last week.", "before monday morning's trial, the lawyer, mo shaoping, saw his client only for one brief meeting, an associate of mo's said.", "xu's wife refused to meet the lawyer before the trial.", "`meeting him would be tantamount to cooperating with the whole charade,' she said in a telephone interview this weekend.", "responding to the accusations during monday morning's trial, xu's lawyer argued that xu had engaged in the peaceful expression of his own views and that this could not amount to subversive activities against the state, an associate of the lawyer said.", "but in a decision that was clearly preordained, the court declared xu guilty and sentenced him to spend what may be much of the rest of his life in prison.", "born in 1943 in the southeastern province of jiangxi, xu was interested in politics even as a teen-ager, his wife said.", "in the 1960s, as an idealistic marxist, he decided to get his learning in society rather than attend a university.", "he served in the navy for five years, then became an electrician with the beijing railroad before becoming involved with the democracy movement and going to prison.", "on monday afternoon, in a police station hours after the trial finished, xu was allowed a half-hour with his wife.", "`he told me he'd be able to handle the pain,' she later recounted in a telephone interview.", "`he said that this would give him time to think things over and calmly reflect on what has happened.'", "ms. he, who has been married to xu since 1971, said she expected to see him in monthly visits to prison.", "the couple has a daughter, xu jin, who is a graduate student in fine arts at boston university.", "in an earlier interview, soon after her husband was arrested on nov. 30, ms. he said xu had told her, `i can't change the way i am.'", "if he received a long sentence, he told his wife, she should go on and enjoy her life.", "`and if i die,' xu said as they parted that day, `please plant a tree for me.'", "six months after president clinton traveled to beijing and challenged china's leaders to move rapidly toward political reform, the administration's policy of engaging beijing was called into question monday when chinese courts sentenced three of the nation's most prominent dissidents to long jail sentences.", "critics of china on capitol hill and human rights groups said the tough prison terms were evidence of the failure of the administration's policy of encouraging trade and diplomatic ties with china in hopes of democratic reform.", "the dissidents _ xu wenli, who was sentenced monday to 13 years in prison, wang youcai, who received an 11-year sentence, and qin yongming, who was reported to have received 12 years were charged with subversion.", "the state department said it had received reports from sources it did not identify that a third leading democracy campaigner, qin yongmin, had been sentenced to 13 years in prison after a trial last week in the city of wuhan.", "relatives of qin in china denied the reports, however, and said that his trial continued.", "given clinton's effusive praise for china's senior leaders during his trip to beijing last summer, the administration found itself on the defensive monday and harshly criticized the prison sentences, even as it continued to insist that the administration's policy of engagement was helping push beijing toward democracy.", "james foley, a state department spokesman, said the united states `deeply deplores' the jail terms and called for the immediate release of the dissidents.", "`these three men appear to have been involved in nothing more than efforts to form a new political party,' he said.", "while condemning the prison sentences, foley and other american officials were careful to note the administration's assessment that there had been progress in human rights in china, some of it linked to clinton's meeting in beijing with chinese president jiang zemin.", "`there had been improvements in the human rights situation in china, modest improvements,' foley said.", "the severe prison terms _ and other recent instances of harassment of democracy campaigners in china _ are `steps backward in relationship to what had been an improved human rights performance,' he said.", "critics of the administration's china policy noted that the long prison sentences were handed out less than a week after jiang delivered a pointed speech in beijing in which he made clear that china's economic reforms were not a prelude to western-style democracy.", "`the western mode of political systems must never be copied,' he said, adding that those who challenged the communist party's supremacy would be crushed.", "rep. nancy pelosi, d-calif., who has long been among china's harshest critics in congress, said the prison sentences handed out to xu and wang were `the clearest demonstration' since the president's visit to china last summer of beijing's `true intentions regarding human rights.'", "`they are pathetic, really pathetic,' she said of the administration.", "`the administration can say what it wants, but it must know monday that its policy on china is an embarrassment.", "what the chinese have learned is that they have all the latitude in the world.'", "mike jendrzejczyk, washington director for human rights group, said the jail terms were proof of the need for the administration to revise its china policy, which he described as `almost entirely' driven by the administration's desire to encourage trade.", "he said that while there had been some signs of progress in the human rights situation in china over the last year _ notably, china's agreement to sign international treaties on civil and economic rights _ the overall picture was bleak.", "`on balance,' he said, `any progress china has made by allowing greater openness may have been canceled out by a more repressive attitude.'", "human rights watch, the largest american-based human rights group, called on the administration to consider postponing or canceling a planned visit to china early next year by commerce secretary william daley and a high-level trade delegation as a protest over the prison sentences.", "`that would get beijing's attention,' jendrzejczck said.", "other china experts and scholars insisted that the administration was right to continue its policy of engagement with china, and that there was reason to believe that political reform would follow economic reform, as clinton has argued.", "peter rodman, a former nixon and reagan administration official now at the nixon center in washington, said that `the united states cannot control the evolution of a society as complex as china's.'", "he said the harsh prison sentences given out monday to the dissidents were to be expected, especially since xu and wang had been involved in trying to set up a political party to challenge the communists.", "`the pattern of this regime is that every once in a while, they ease up a bit and somebody goes too far and there's a crisis,' he said.", "`i don't think you can blame the united states for this crackdown, nor can you give us credit for any political reforms.", "on human rights, i just don't think
